			<p>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</p><p>The series of letters printed in these volumes, in-<lb/>dividual in themselves, make an almost unique com-<lb/>bination. The time of writing, the crisis through<lb/>which not only the nation but republican institu-<lb/>tions were passing, the inheritance and position of the<lb/>writers, and the personal characteristics of each as<lb/>shown in the letters and as developed in later days,<lb/>unite to give interest to the subjects treated and the<lb/>manner of presentation. They are family letters, writ-<lb/>ten in all the freedom of family intercourse, selected<lb/>from what would fill many volumes; they are much<lb/>more than family letters, for the description of social<lb/>conditions, the discussion of public questions, and the<lb/>wide relations held by the writers, make them a con-<lb/>tribution to the social, military and diplomatic his-<lb/>tory of the War of Secession, unequalled in scope and<lb/>concentrated interest.</p><p>For nearly a century the Adams family of Massa-<lb/>chusetts had filled high public office, a succession of<lb/>students of government, of able administrators, whose<lb/>independence and upright character commanded rec-<lb/>ognition. The third generation had as its represent-<lb/>ative Charles Francis Adams, the favored son of John<lb/>Quincy Adams. On the election of Lincoln to the<lb/>Presidency Mr. Adams was nominated to be Minister<lb/>of the United States to Great Britain and was at once<lb/>confirmed by the Senate.

The act, justified in international law, was<lb/>interpreted as unfriendly, and seemed in fact to repre-<lb/>sent the feeling of suspicion and hostility of the rul-<lb/>ing class in England towards the American republic,<lb/>a feeling that found expression in sympathy for the<lb/>South, in the wish for its success and in a hope that a<lb/>divided people would remove anxiety on the growth<lb/>of a democracy that could not be confined to present<lb/>bounds, and the influence of which on old institutions<lb/>of Europe was already felt.</p><p>The almost complete isolation of the Minister for<lb/>months after his arrival in London is a strange phe-<lb/>nomenon. The requirements of official etiquette were<lb/>fulfilled, but little beyond that came to welcome the<lb/>strangers. Mr. Adams himself was, indeed, no stranger<lb/>in England. When his father held the same office,<lb/>immediately after the close of the War of 1812, the<lb/>son had been in an English school. This experience<lb/>served him well in 1861. He knew the English char-<lb/>acteristics, he had been trained in their methods, he<lb/>could divine how the English mind would think, and<lb/>so forecast the resulting action. The English reserve<lb/>and self-restraint were no greater than his own. He<lb/>could anticipate the manner of expressing a difference<lb/>of opinion, and provide against surprise by an unex-<lb/>pected performance. He was thoroughly grounded in<lb/>the history of the United States, in the relations which<lb/>had subsisted between the United States and Great<lb/>Britain, and in republican government, with its ever-</p><p/>

No man in American public life was by<lb/>inheritance, training and matured convictions, so well<lb/>fitted to occupy this office at so delicate and critical<lb/>a time. The seven years of service in London mark<lb/>the highest point of Mr. Adams' career. Facing perils<lb/>where a misstep would have involved catastrophe,<lb/>ruin to himself and destruction to his country, he made<lb/>no mistake, no surrender to temporary advantage,<lb/>no concession of right or principle. Against public<lb/>clamor at home, at times against the instructions of his<lb/>superior, the Secretary of State, and against the pres-<lb/>sure of Americans and plotting Southerners in Europe,<lb/>he calmly pursued his course. His abilities, prescience<lb/>and acts have been fully justified by time and events.<lb/>Never had American diplomacy in Europe been at as<lb/>low an ebb as in 1861; never had American policy,<lb/>domestic as well as foreign, stood as high as in 1868, and<lb/>nowhere higher than in England. To Mr. Adams the<lb/>country largely owed this change ; it was a great achieve-<lb/>ment, the greater because of the difficulties overcome.<lb/>The son, Charles Francis Adams, Jr., had graduated<lb/>from Harvard College in 1856, and was now in the<lb/>office of Richard Henry Dana studying law but grad-<lb/>ually becoming aware that law was not his proper<lb/>vocation. He had the same distaste for its practice<lb/>that had repelled his grandfather, John Quincy Adams.<lb/>He had grown up in an atmosphere of political dis-<lb/>cussion, had been accustomed to consider public ques-<lb/>tions, and was forming connections in journalism as<lb/>a possible future field for public service.

Restive<lb/>under the inaction of a law office, he chafed under the<lb/>idea of confinement, of wasted energy and little prom-<lb/>ise of improvement. His father's service in Congress<lb/>interested him far more than anything that Kent or<lb/>Blackstone could offer, and in his communications to<lb/>the newspapers he was no more blind to the rapidly ap-<lb/>proaching crisis in the contest between the North and<lb/>the South than were his older contemporaries. Con-<lb/>scious of a certain capacity of expression he believed<lb/>the career of publicist offered him better expectations<lb/>than any other calling, and subsequent events proved<lb/>him in this to have been correct.</p><p>Thus situated when actual war began, only the<lb/>responsibilities imposed by his father's absence pre-<lb/>vented the son from at once entering the army. His<lb/>older brother, John Quincy Adams, was on the staff<lb/>of Governor Andrew, proving his capacity and aiding<lb/>in despatching to the front the regiments so speed-<lb/>ily sent from Massachusetts. He saw his college and<lb/>social companions eagerly enrolling their names and<lb/>as eagerly accepted for service. The most available<lb/>member of the family for the army, his strong sense of<lb/>duty to his father kept him back, until he felt that his<lb/>duty to his country overshadowed all other calls. Of<lb/>his service in the war he has given a bare outline in<lb/>his "Autobiography"; but his letters are far more de-<lb/>tailed, and describe, as is nowhere better described, the<lb/>daily life of a cavalry officer.</p><p/>

			<p>INTRODUCTORY NOTE xi</p><p>The development of character under discipline and<lb/>experience, the ripening of mind and opinions by close<lb/>contact with his fellow men and with the questions<lb/>of army administration, and the growing richness of<lb/>observation and expression, appear in his letters. He<lb/>entered the army a restive, unformed youth, without<lb/>settled ambition or recognized powers; he left it a man<lb/>of strengthened mind, of broadened views, and with a<lb/>defined future and true calling. The younger Adams<lb/>of 1865 was a far different being from the younger<lb/>Adams of 1861, and he always looked back with in-<lb/>terest on his military service as contributing to his<lb/>later success. It is rare to find a soldier capable of<lb/>giving an interesting account of his routine duties,<lb/>of narrating in a logical manner successive events, of<lb/>speculating justly on a summary of facts, or of sketch-<lb/>ing in a few words a man's character so as to present a<lb/>vivid likeness. He is usually inarticulate, or expends<lb/>the little gift he has in minor details without the needed<lb/>binding relation. Mr. Adams formed the exception.<lb/>He could write and he had, though unknown to him-<lb/>self, the best qualities of the historian.</p><p>In his "Education" Henry Adams has given a self-<lb/>drawn representation of himself as a "failure," and<lb/>in a manner that awakens astonishment and challenges<lb/>examination. To have been successful in everything<lb/>that he attempted Ã¢ÂÂ teaching, science, history, fiction<lb/>and criticism Ã¢ÂÂ would have satisfied an ordinary mor-<lb/>tal. But that was exactly what he was not, and the<lb/>various readings given to his confessions prove how<lb/>exceptional he was. He also passed through Harvard</p><p/>

What those years did for him may be traced in<lb/>his later writings. Before their effects could be felt he<lb/>passed the winter of 1860-61 in Washington, a keen<lb/>observer of passing events, forming independent judg-<lb/>ments upon them, while enjoying to the full the advan-<lb/>tage of his father's opinions and relations with public<lb/>men. The months thus spent trained his powers of<lb/>observation and analysis, so fruitful when applied to<lb/>his English experience. For he became confidential<lb/>secretary to his father in London, a position unrecog-<lb/>nized, as it was also unpaid, by the government. He<lb/>used the opportunity wisely and with advantage to the<lb/>father.</p><p>His early letters are in tone very like his "Educa-<lb/>tion." There is the same detachment, the same quality<lb/>of critic under the guise of philosopher, the same per-<lb/>sistent note of irony, the same apparent indifference<lb/>to results, the same, though less defined, gift of expres-<lb/>sion. It has been said that it was a "pose" and the<lb/>man was insincere, but those who were closest to him<lb/>in later life knew that such a charge was not true. He<lb/>was keenly interested in running a problem to earth;<lb/>once apprehended, he turned to other things, looking<lb/>upon the achievement as rather futile, unworthy of the<lb/>effort made to master it. In the wealth of his ability<lb/>he could afford to take such a position, and his letters<lb/>show that in this respect his whole life was consistent.<lb/>He had tasted of newspaper correspondence and be-<lb/>lieved he could cultivate the taste when in London.</p><p/>

The history of the War of<lb/>Secession has been told and retold in its every phase,<lb/>and no letters could relate the old story in a connected<lb/>manner. Yet in the contemporary record which follows<lb/>will be found no little new history, much untold detail,<lb/>much discussion, many rumors and predictions, ex-<lb/>pressed with individuality and in a literary form. The<lb/>progress of the great conflict supplies the background,<lb/>against which stand prominently personal experiences,<lb/>hopes and fears.

The attack was neither<lb/>so vigorous nor so confident, whilst the defence was<lb/>bolder and more strenuous. The first effective stroke<lb/>came from Lord John Russell, which I did not get in<lb/>time to hear. , The next was from Mr. Cobden, which<lb/>was plain, direct and evidently telling on the House.<lb/>The decisive blow came, however, from Mr. Gladstone,<lb/>who stood like a bull in the arena surrounded by dogs.<lb/>He began by tossing the very last one who had attacked<lb/>him, and he went on with every one in turn, until he<lb/>had them all sprawling on the ground.

For years our family has talked of<lb/>slavery and of the South, and been most prominent<lb/>in the contest of words, and now that it has come to<lb/>blows, does it become us to stand aloof from the con-<lb/>flict?

The<lb/>rush for commissions is tremendous and you can only<lb/>get one by shoving somebody equally capable with<lb/>yourself aside, and you can really do no service, if you<lb/>get one, which would not be equally well done if you<lb/>were away.

Start<lb/>at once with the paradox that, instead of desiring to<lb/>break this blockade, England should pray it might last<lb/>for two years and if necessary assist in enforcing it, as<lb/>if enforced its inevitable result must be, after one or at<lb/>most two years of high prices, to forever break down<lb/>'the price of cotton to a reasonable profit over the cost<lb/>of its cheapest possible production. This opens the<lb/>whole question of supply. Two things are necessary<lb/>to the production of cotton Ã¢ÂÂ an abundance of labor<lb/>and a cotton soil. Look into the question of soil first.<lb/>A semi-tropical heat, with a distribution of rain, are<lb/>the only essentials. India has not the last and will not<lb/>do; but Central and South America, all Africa (which<lb/>is not desert), Australia and the Fiji Islands are better</p><p/>

Now is England's chance to free herself<lb/>from what has been her terror for years. In India, in<lb/>Egypt, in Abyssinia and in South Africa, there is an<lb/>unlimited amount of cotton land of the finest quality<lb/>and labor is abundant, costing almost nothing, but<lb/>unorganized. Two years' competition will organize it<lb/>and once organized it can sell the South. In Australia,<lb/>the South Sea islands and Central America, there is<lb/>no labor and here the cooley question rises. Properly<lb/>regulated the trade would be a blessing, for the Chi-<lb/>nese amalgamates and California is in point as well as<lb/>Dana's reflections on Cuba.

It is not as if the cotton manufacture alone<lb/>suffered, but the tariff and the war have between<lb/>them cut off the whole American trade, export and<lb/>import, and the consequence has been a very bad<lb/>season, with a prospect of frightful pressure in the<lb/>winter.

My<lb/>friend Richardson goes in the Arabia to Boston, if he<lb/>can, but I'm not sure that he won't have to make Hali-<lb/>fax his terminus. He was in a horrible position. His<lb/>family and property are in New Orleans and he has a<lb/>brother in the Virginian army. He is himself a good<lb/>Union man, I believe; at all events he talks so; but he<lb/>does not want to do anything which will separate him<lb/>from his family or make them his enemies. So he could<lb/>not make up his mind to take the oath, and deter-<lb/>mined rather to run his risk without a passport. I be-<lb/>lieve he means to pass the winter in Boston. He told<lb/>me all about his troubles and I strongly advised him<lb/>not to think of ever living in New Orleans again; at<lb/>least as an architect.</p><p>Sohier and Charley Thorndike have been here this<lb/>week. Both leave for Paris this morning. Sohier was<lb/>quite amusing, and dined with us twice. But the trouble<lb/>about London is that no one ever stays here and I can't<lb/>keep a companion. As for Englishmen I don't expect to<lb/>know any of my own age for at least six months more,<lb/>as this club business has got to be settled and the<lb/>season to come round again first. We see no English<lb/>people now, or very few, and the fogs are thick al-<lb/>most every morning. Hooroar!

While the agents of the Confederates<lb/>are abroad working the whole time at public opinion<lb/>and at the foreign mind, influencing papers and think-<lb/>ers and undermining us the whole time, our press at<lb/>home does but furnish them the materials they need<lb/>and our agents abroad apparently confine their efforts<lb/>to cabinets and officials and leave public opinion and<lb/>the press to take care of themselves. This may not be<lb/>so in fact, but if it is not, all that can be said is that the<lb/>Southern emissaries are far more efficient than ours.<lb/>We have money and the command of the sea, so that<lb/>Europe can know nothing except through us, and yet,<lb/>from the beginning, so much more active and efficient<lb/>has the South been, that we have done nothing but lose<lb/>ground.

The speech has been made<lb/>the subject of most severe criticism and that too from<lb/>men hitherto Sumner's friends.

For myself I'm<lb/>glad the speech was made, though I think very differ-<lb/>ently from most in these matters. The education is<lb/>going on and the fallacies lie hid.

I went out to<lb/>camp about eight days ago in the dead of winter, and<lb/>when the strong north wind blew. Sunday we struck<lb/>our camp and moved for the South. It was n't a pleas-<lb/>ant day, for the Blue Hills looked cold and dreary and<lb/>snow packed on the deserted camp ground; and while<lb/>the earth was covered with ice the sky was grey and<lb/>uncompromising and the wind rough and cold. It was<lb/>dismal enough I assure you and I was glad enough<lb/>when we were hurried into the cars. John was the only<lb/>person to see me off, much to my relief, for I was<lb/>in the cross and hungry rather than the sentimental<lb/>mood.</p><p>Then came a chapter of accidents. Our Major got<lb/>drunk before we left and has continued so ever since,<lb/>and the battalion has taken care of itself. That officer<lb/>has now disappeared, we hope forever, and at last we<lb/>have got ourselves comfortably quartered. We are<lb/>barracked in a German amusement building and grove<lb/>on 64th street, and our horses are stabled in large sheds<lb/>not far off, and the room in which I am writing is the<lb/>parlor and sleeping room of the officers and the head-</p><p/>

As for me I never was better in my<lb/>life. The exposure has been pretty severe and the<lb/>change of life great; but I am always well in the open<lb/>air and jolly among a crowd of fellows, so no sympathy<lb/>need be wasted on me. I like it and like it better than<lb/>I expected. I fall into the life very easily and find<lb/>my spring experience at the fort of inestimable service.<lb/>Already I feel as much at home in charge of the guard<lb/>or the company stables as I ever did in my office. I 'm<lb/>sure if I like it so far I shall continue to do so, for we've<lb/>had a pretty rough time, and Caspar Crowninshield<lb/>says the most disgusting he ever had. But I certainly<lb/>like it so far and expect to continue to do so.</p><p>We are off soon Ã¢ÂÂ probably within ten days Ã¢ÂÂ for<lb/>Port Royal. We like the idea fairly, though we would<lb/>prefer to go to other places. For myself I should prefer<lb/>to winter at Annapolis, and next to that to be sent to<lb/>Texas, but as for being cooped up on Hilton Head all<lb/>winter, I don't relish the idea much, though as regards<lb/>climate it will be a pleasant change. As for active serv-<lb/>ice, it's just impossible. You could n't get our horses<lb/>within a mile of firearms, and the drilling task before<lb/>us is something terrible to contemplate. We are all<lb/>green, officers, men and horses, and long practice is<lb/>absolutely necessary. But we can do, I imagine, picket<lb/>and camp duty. My wants (?) will probably be found<lb/>on board ship.</p><p/>

The small list of friends that we have are<lb/>not always so American as one would like. So we<lb/>generally dodge "exposure" as much as possible.

The Times gently skinned me and the<lb/>Examiner scalped me with considerable savageness.<lb/>For myself I care about as much for the Times or the<lb/>Examiner as I do for the Pekin Gazette; but, unfortu-<lb/>nately, the American Minister in London is at this time<lb/>an object of considerable prominence; an eyesore to<lb/>an influential and somewhat unscrupulous portion<lb/>of the community. Accordingly I form a convenient<lb/>head to punch when people feel vicious and pugna-<lb/>cious. I have, therefore, to change the metaphor, found<lb/>it necessary to take in every spare inch of canvas and<lb/>to run (on a lee-shore) under double-close-reefed miz-<lb/>zen to' gallant skysails, before a tremendous gale. In<lb/>other words I have made myself as little an object of<lb/>attack as possible. This reduces my means of useful-<lb/>ness to almost nothing and I might just as well be any-<lb/>where as here, except that I can't leave the parent<lb/>birds thus afloat on the raging tide.</p><p/>

They like his letters,<lb/>as we all do, but wish there were more of them and<lb/>longer. At last accounts he Was doing the fever and<lb/>toping on quinine. I hope you will forswear that lux-<lb/>ury, not uncommon, it appears, in that neighborhood.</p><p>We are dreading the next news.

My last to you, if I re-<lb/>member right, was from on shipboard nearly three<lb/>months ago, and was of a savage tenor. This is from<lb/>an old South Carolina plantation, the headquarters of<lb/>our cavalry pickets, and is likely to be of an eminently<lb/>pacific tone. Here I am surrounded by troopers, mis-<lb/>sionaries, contrabands, cotton fields and serpents, in a<lb/>summer climate, riding immensely every day, dread-<lb/>fully sick of the monotony of my present existence,<lb/>disgusted with all things military and fighting off ma-<lb/>laria with whiskey and tobacco. So far, the island of<lb/>Port Royal is a small Paradise, and no men were ever<lb/>so fortunate in the inception of a military career, bar-<lb/>ring the immense labor of organizing such a regiment<lb/>as this and our peculiarly rigid discipline, than we have<lb/>been. So far our privations have been next to nothing<lb/>and our career has been more that of a winter picnic<lb/>than anything else. The future I fear has less agree-<lb/>able things in store for us. Still sweets cloy, and drilling<lb/>in a South Carolina cotton field hour after hour daily<lb/>for weeks in succession is one of those sweets which<lb/>cloy early.

My<lb/>horse was tied to a tree and my pistols and coat lay<lb/>near him, while I, in heavy boots and spurs and my<lb/>shirt sleeves, handled a spade by the side of my sable<lb/>brethren in the midst of a combination of rice-field<lb/>and cotton swamp, while my sergeant, axe in hand,<lb/>headed another gang in clearing away underbrush. I<lb/>am happy to say such energy was not unrewarded, as<lb/>I succeeded in connecting and repairing three miles of<lb/>road in one day instead of two, as I calculated. I am<lb/>happy to say the Africs worked well and spared me<lb/>much prepared execration; but from personal experi-<lb/>ence I am qualified to assert, that an African has about<lb/>as much idea of a shovel and its uses as a wild Irish-<lb/>man might have of a quadrant or a cotton-hoe.

While Government has sent agents down<lb/>here, private philanthropy has sent missionaries, and<lb/>while the first see that the contrabands earn their<lb/>bread, the last teach them the alphabet. Between the<lb/>two I predict divers results, among which are numer-<lb/>ous jobs for agents and missionaries, small comfort to<lb/>the negroes and heavy loss to the Government. Doubt-<lb/>less the world must have cotton and must pay for it,<lb/>but it does not yet know what it is to pay for it if the<lb/>future hath it in store that the poor world shall buy<lb/>the next crop of Port Royal at prices remunerative to<lb/>Government. The scheme, so far as I can see any,<lb/>seems to be for the Government, recognizing and en-<lb/>couraging private philanthropy and leaving to it the<lb/>task of educating the slaves to the standard of self-<lb/>support, to hold itself a sort of guardian to the slave<lb/>in his indefinite state of transition, exacting from him<lb/>that amount of labor which he owes to the community<lb/>and the cotton market. The plan may work well; if it<lb/>does, it will be the first of the kind that ever has. Cer-<lb/>tainly I do not envy the slaves its operation. The po-<lb/>sition of the Government is certainly a most difficult<lb/>one. Something must be done for these poor people<lb/>and done at once. They are indolent, shiftless, unable<lb/>to take care of themselves and plundered by every<lb/>comer Ã¢ÂÂ in short, they are slaves. For the present<lb/>they must be provided for. It is easy to find fault with<lb/>the present plan. Can any one suggest a better? For<lb/>me, I must confess that I cannot. I think it bad, very</p><p/>

The whole system of cotton growing Ã¢ÂÂ all<lb/>its machinery from the slave to the hoe in his hand Ã¢ÂÂ<lb/>is awkward, cumbrous, expensive and behind the age.<lb/>That the cultivation of cotton is so behind that of all<lb/>the other great staples is the natural result of mo-<lb/>nopoly, but it is none the less disgraceful to the world,<lb/>and to give it an impulse seems to have been the mis-<lb/>sion of this war.

That they will be free and free soon by the<lb/>operation of economic laws over which Government<lb/>has no control, I thoroughly believe; but their freedom<lb/>will be the freedom of antiquated and unprofitable<lb/>machines, the freedom of the hoes they use which will<lb/>be swept aside to make way for better implements.<lb/>The slave, however, cannot be swept aside and herein<lb/>lies the difficulty and the problem. My impression<lb/>from what I see is that Emancipation as a Government<lb/>measure would be a terrible calamity to the blacks as a<lb/>race; that rapid emancipation as the result of an eco-<lb/>nomic revolution destroying their value as agricultural<lb/>machines would be a calamity, though less severe; and<lb/>finally, that the only transition to freedom absolutely<lb/>beneficial to them as a race would be one proportioned<lb/>in length to the length of their captivity, such a one<lb/>in fact as destroyed villeinage in the wreck of the feu-<lb/>dal system. Were men and governments what they<lb/>should be instead of what they are, the case would be<lb/>different and all would combine in the Christian and<lb/>tedious effort to patiently undo the wrongs they had<lb/>done, and to restore to the African his attributes.<lb/>Then the work could be done well and quickly; but<lb/>at present, seeing what men are, and how remorselessly<lb/>they throw aside what has ceased to be useful, I can-<lb/>not but regard as a doubtful benefit to the African<lb/>anything which by diminishing his value increases his<lb/>chances of freedom.</p><p>A revolution in cotton production springing from<lb/>competition may work differently by gradually chang-</p><p/>

The<lb/>census already shows not only that cotton can every-<lb/>where be cultivated by free labor, but also that the<lb/>best cotton now is so cultivated, and the most probable<lb/>result of a permanent reduction in the price of cotton<lb/>would seem to me to be a sudden influx of free white<lb/>emigration into the cotton fields of the South. Such a<lb/>result would produce untold advantages to the South,<lb/>to America and to the white race; but how about the<lb/>blacks? Will they be educated and encouraged and<lb/>cared for; or will they be challenged to compete in the<lb/>race, or go to the wall, and finally be swept away as a<lb/>useless rubbish? Who can answer those queries? I for<lb/>one cannot; but one thing I daily see and that is that<lb/>no spirit exists among the contrabands here which<lb/>would enable them to care for themselves in a race of<lb/>vigorous competition.

Then<lb/>last night I took him to Monckton Milnes, where he<lb/>was the object of considerable interest.

Cobden was very good<lb/>too. He damaged Horsman dreadfully. But the most<lb/>striking part of the debate was that not a word as to<lb/>America or interference was said in it. This was pecul-<lb/>iar because the debate was on the subject of retrench-<lb/>ment, and retrenchment was necessary because of the<lb/>American war. Six months ago such a debate would<lb/>not have taken place, but in its place we should have<lb/>had war speeches with no end.</p><p>Our position here now, putting aside a few diplo-<lb/>matic questions, is much as it might be at home.

In-<lb/>deed the position we have here is one of a great deal of<lb/>weight, and of course so long as our armies march for-<lb/>ward, so long our hands are elevated higher and higher<lb/>until we bump the stars. I hear very little about our<lb/>friend Mason. He is said to be very anxious and to fear<lb/>a rebellion within the rebellion.

In the hottest fire he grew genial and took the<lb/>occasion of a shell splashing us with mud to tell me an<lb/>old and not very good story. Then the retreat was<lb/>ordered and he grew savage, though not to us; and<lb/>finally I thought old Benham would have to put him<lb/>under arrest, he treated him with such undisguised con-<lb/>tempt. My rides round the battle field too were curi-<lb/>ous. Here was a long line of wounded men toiling to<lb/>the rear, and the different ways in which they bore<lb/>their wounds, from the coward limping off untouched<lb/>to the plucky fellow with his leg hanging by the skin<lb/>making faces that he might not yell.

My conclusion is that before long the<lb/>attempt to keep a large army in the field must be<lb/>abandoned, and that from that time hostilities will be<lb/>continued by small bands who will sustain themselves<lb/>by levies on the country. Such is the policy sketched<lb/>out by Mr. Yancey in a letter to somebody here of<lb/>which I have heard.

Should you<lb/>at the end of the war, wish to take my place, in case<lb/>the services of one of us were still required, I should re-<lb/>turn to Boston and Horace Gray, and I really do not<lb/>know whether I should regret the change. The truth<lb/>is, the experience of four years has done little towards<lb/>giving me confidence in myself. The more I see, the<lb/>more I am convinced that a man whose mind is bal-<lb/>anced like mine, in such a way that what is evil never<lb/>seems unmixed with good, and what is good always<lb/>streaked with evil; an object seems never important<lb/>enough to call out strong energies till they are ex-<lb/>hausted, nor necessary enough not to allow of its fail-<lb/>ure being possible to retrieve; in short, a mind which<lb/>is not strongly positive and absolute, cannot be steadily<lb/>successful in action, which requires quietness and per-<lb/>severance.

It's all random, in-<lb/>sulated work, for special and temporary and personal<lb/>purposes, and we have no means, power or hope of<lb/>combined action for any unselfish end.</p><p>One man who has real ability may do a great deal,<lb/>but we ought to have a more concentrated power of<lb/>influence than any that now exists.</p><p>For the present war I have nothing to say.

It was a cold,<lb/>clear, November evening, with a cold, red, western<lb/>sky and, chilled through, with a prospect of only a<lb/>supperless bivouac, a stronger home feeling came over<lb/>me than I have often felt before, and I did sadly dwell<lb/>in my imagination on the intense comfort there is in<lb/>a thoroughly warm, well-lighted room and well-spread<lb/>table after a long cold ride. However I got into camp<lb/>before it was dark and here things were not so bad.<lb/>The wind was all down, the fires were blazing and we<lb/>had the elements of comfort. The soup Lou sent me<lb/>supplied me with a hot supper Ã¢ÂÂ in fact I don't know<lb/>what I should have done if it had not been for that,<lb/>through this dreary march; and after that I spread my<lb/>blankets on a bed of fir-branches close to the fire and<lb/>slept as serenely as man could desire to sleep.</p><p>The next morning the weather changed and it gradu-<lb/>ally grew warmer and more cloudy all day.

Except<lb/>in rains tents are wholly unnecessary Ã¢ÂÂ articles of<lb/>luxury. Here, the night before Thanksgiving and cold<lb/>at that, I slept as soundly and warmly before our fire<lb/>as I could have done in bed at home. The reason is<lb/>plain.

It was a fine clear day, with a sharp chill<lb/>in the little wind which was stirring.

The weather was delight-<lb/>ful and we had nothing to do but to while away the<lb/>time watching our neighbors and listening to the can-<lb/>nonade. The Pennsylvanians were a source of endless<lb/>delight to Davis and myself Ã¢ÂÂ they were so ragged, so<lb/>independent, and so very peculiar.

Water<lb/>they had not now and soap they had evidently never<lb/>known; but they were old soldiers, for they cooked<lb/>strange messes and when boots and saddles sounded,<lb/>undisturbed by the cannonade they would saddle their<lb/>horses carefully, slowly and meditatively, evidently<lb/>with respect for the beast if not in the fear of God.<lb/>They compared so curiously with our own men so com-<lb/>paratively young, clean and well dressed, full of intelli-<lb/>gence and yet subject to such rigid and never ending<lb/>discipline. Then as the afternoon crept on the most<lb/>beautiful lights and shadows I ever saw crept over the<lb/>little hollow in which our friends were encamped, the<lb/>smoke of the camp fires rising among the pines, while<lb/>the sunlight played round the horses and riders among<lb/>them gave effects which in pictures we should declare<lb/>unnatural.

At<lb/>daybreak the usual firing began and at times there<lb/>seemed to be explosions of musketry and cannon, but<lb/>it was not at all the fire of yesterday. Our horses were<lb/>still kept saddled and all our traps packed, but I had<lb/>ceased to believe that we should move, and lay peace-<lb/>ably before my fire, enjoying the soft air and the<lb/>strange livery scene and reading Browning's poems.</p><p>Towards evening rumors of some great success were<lb/>rife and made us all very cheerful, and we again hoped<lb/>soon to be in the saddle and following the enemy briskly<lb/>up on the road to Richmond. I put less faith in the<lb/>rumors than most and accordingly next day my dis-<lb/>appointment was less. For next day our hopes most<lb/>suddenly collapsed.

That night it rained smartly<lb/>and, as usual, the drops pattering on my face reminded<lb/>me that we were in bivouac. Like a knowing cam-<lb/>paigner I called to my servant to throw my rubber<lb/>poncho over me, pulled my boots under the blankets<lb/>and my cape over my head and chuckled myself to<lb/>sleep, as the rain came down harder and harder, to<lb/>think how comfortable I was and how very much I had<lb/>got ahead of the elements this time.

One of these details was to consist<lb/>of picked men and horses, carefully armed, with three<lb/>days' rations and twenty pounds of forage, and of these<lb/>Colonel Curtis had command and Channing Clapp<lb/>went with him as Major.

Both details got off at eight<lb/>o'clock the morning of the 30th, Colonel Curtis report-<lb/>ing to General Aver ell in person and I to Major White<lb/>of the 3d Pennsylvania. Evidently something was on<lb/>foot.

Our force was about 325, far inferior<lb/>men and horses, and I imagined we were merely to act<lb/>as a reserve or to support a battery. It took us a long<lb/>time to get off and it was while waiting in the saddle,<lb/>on a chilly, cloudy December morning, that I received<lb/>all your letters of November 21st, informing me of<lb/>Sallie Hampton's death among other facts.</p><p/>

We were to march with the utmost despatch and<lb/>caution to Warrenton Junction, there rest and feed,<lb/>and start at the proper time to arrive at Warrenton<lb/>at daylight, "where," the orders went on, "you will<lb/>find two companies of rebel cavalry.

White winked at me and I winked<lb/>at White, and immediately I went to the rear, changed<lb/>my mare for my heavy old working brute, and sent her,<lb/>my servant and all my possessions back within the<lb/>picket and then rejoined White and we went on our<lb/>way rejoicing in the cold, heavy, rainy December after-<lb/>noon.

They<lb/>were very civil and certainly exhibited no signs of dis-<lb/>trust or fear, and we justified their confidence; for, as<lb/>soon as we had rushed through the town and sent our<lb/>men up all manner of streets, satisfying ourselves that<lb/>there was no organized body of rebels in that town, we<lb/>turned round and left the town according to our orders<lb/>on our way home.

You<lb/>may think my advice absurd and never return to it<lb/>again. I tell you I know you and I have tried the ex-<lb/>periment on myself, and I here suggest what you most<lb/>need, and what you will never be a man without. If<lb/>you joined an expedition to the North pole you might<lb/>not discover that terra incognita, but you would dis-<lb/>cover many facts about yourself which would amply<lb/>repay you the trouble you had had.

They will fight yet, but they<lb/>fight for defeat, just as a brave, bad rider will face a<lb/>fence, but yet rides for a fall. There is a great deal<lb/>of croaking, no confidence, plenty of sickness, and<lb/>desertion is the order of the day. This arises from<lb/>various causes; partly from the defeat at Fredericks-<lb/>burg and the failure, but mostly from the change of<lb/>commanders of late. You or others may wonder or<lb/>agree, as you choose, but it is a fact that McClellan<lb/>alone has the confidence of this army. They would<lb/>rally and fight under him tomorrow and under him<lb/>only. Burnside has lost, and Hooker never had their<lb/>confidence.</p><p>Under these circumstances my mind recurs more<lb/>and more to the plan of the war which I suggested to<lb/>you in my last letters from Hilton Head, after the<lb/>seven days' fight. This army I now think should be<lb/>broken up and the bulk of it at once transferred to the<lb/>South West, where it could seize and hold against<lb/>everything the territory west of the Mississippi. This<lb/>would give us that river and its tributaries, including<lb/>the States of Tennessee and Kentucky; it would cir-<lb/>cumscribe and ultimately destroy the Southern con-<lb/>federacy, and would settle forever the slavery question<lb/>in the young South West. One measure alone would de-<lb/>cide all this : let the army know that they are to have the<lb/>territory they occupy and Congress pass liberal laws<lb/>encouraging the army to settle where they have fought.<lb/>I think that at least 100,000 fighting men would</p><p/>

I think he touches as with a needle's point the<lb/>radical defect of our military system. They have al-<lb/>ways impaired the efficiency of our troops. I can see<lb/>clearly the reason why we have not made an ade-<lb/>quate use of the multitude we have summoned to<lb/>the field. Two armies of a hundred thousand men each,<lb/>properly officered, would have done more than our<lb/>million.</p><p>In the meantime the people of this country have so<lb/>far changed their views as it respects our share in the<lb/>strife, as to give me a fresh source of occupation in<lb/>the work of transmitting addresses and resolutions of<lb/>crowded meetings everywhere. The anti-slavery feel-<lb/>ing has been astonishingly revived by the President's<lb/>proclamation and the kindly disposition by the sup-<lb/>plies furnished to Lancashire. It is however to be noted<lb/>that all this manifestation comes from the working and<lb/>middle classes. The malevolence of the aristocracy<lb/>continues just as strong as ever. Every item of news<lb/>that favors the notion of division and disintegration is<lb/>eagerly caught up. I only wish our people could be<lb/>here a little while and see what is hoped from their dif-<lb/>ferences of opinion. If it did not have the effect of<lb/>smoothing them all down into the pursuit of a common<lb/>object, then there is not a particle of patriotism left<lb/>among them. . . .</p><p/>

This went on<lb/>for a couple of hundred yards, when at last I got my<lb/>horse under, and out of the woods into the road, when<lb/>I found myself galloping along with the rear of the<lb/>fugitives, side by side with Major Robinson.

If it scared the rebs,<lb/>it scared my line also, which was forming a little to the<lb/>right and rear and I saw the rascals wavering on the<lb/>verge of a panic, while I heard Robinson calling on<lb/>them to come up, for his men were leaving. "I clearly<lb/>can't drive them," thought I, "perhaps they'll follow<lb/>me," and I spurred my horse forward and shouted,<lb/>"Come on, follow me, there they are," waving my<lb/>sword Ã¢ÂÂ all in the most improved patterns; but the<lb/>disciples of Penn did n't see it in that light, and as I<lb/>looked over my shoulder I saw my line vanishing from<lb/>both flanks and the centre on the road home. Then<lb/>wrath seized my soul and I uttered a yell and chased<lb/>them. I caught a hapless cuss and cut him over the<lb/>head with my sabre. It only lent a new horror and<lb/>fresh speed to his flight. I whanged another over the<lb/>face and he tarried for a while.

I called them "curs," "dogs," and "cowards,"<lb/>a "disgrace to the 16th Pennsylvania, as the 16th was<lb/>a disgrace to the service," and so I finally prevailed on<lb/>about half of my line to stop for this time.</p><p>Meanwhile the firing had ceased and no more rebs<lb/>were in sight.

In a few minutes we had settled<lb/>on a sort of plan and I went into the woods with a<lb/>dozen men to cover our flank and skirmish. I scattered<lb/>my men along and encouraged them with the informa-<lb/>tion that at the first sign of wavering I should shoot the<lb/>first man I came to, and I portentously flourished my<lb/>pistol.

Last night, or April 4th and in Vir-<lb/>ginia, we had a violent and pelting snow storm and<lb/>this morning the country is again under water, and hills,<lb/>forts and camps are white with snow. Yesterday the<lb/>wind was north all day and cold and violent Ã¢ÂÂ such as<lb/>we remember in early March in Washington Ã¢ÂÂ accom-<lb/>panied with clouds of dust. I was out in it all day, for<lb/>I was sent out to inspect the pickets, and starting at<lb/>nine a.m. did not get in until half past three p.m.<lb/>Cold, dreary, uninteresting work, riding from post to<lb/>post and putting the same questions and receiving the<lb/>same answers from all manner of stupid men.

He was in<lb/>company with a Captain Batchelder and soon opened<lb/>his business. He was sent by General Griffin, on whose<lb/>staff they both were, to offer me the position of aid on<lb/>the same staff. General Griffin is a well known officer<lb/>of the old army, a Brigadier now in command of a<lb/>Division, a young man and highly reputed. An officer<lb/>of the old army, he never drinks, and he married one<lb/>of our old Washington acquaintances, the Carrolls.<lb/>So much for General Griffin, whom I had never seen<lb/>but whose staff I should consider one of the most de-<lb/>sirable in the army. I intimated to Bliss what my an-<lb/>swer would be, and told him that I would express my<lb/>acknowledgments to the General in person next day.<lb/>Accordingly Major Higginson and I rode over at four<lb/>o'clock to dine. Before dinner I had my audience<lb/>and politely declined the proffered situation. I found<lb/>Griffin a young, rather handsome man, with a face<lb/>expressive of a good deal of resolution and energy,<lb/>pleasant manners and a good deal of conversation.<lb/>I told him that I was fully sensible of the great advan-<lb/>tages and yet greater comforts which the proposed<lb/>situation offered me. I did not deny that I was un-<lb/>comfortable and ill at ease where I was, and that my<lb/>chances of rising and of knowing what was going on<lb/>would be much greater with him; but I told him I could<lb/>not accept his offer for two reasons. First, if I did so<lb/>I must yet retain my commission in my regiment. For<lb/>a captain to do this I did not consider right. He knew</p><p/>

In it all officers had to act for themselves<lb/>and on their own responsibility. We were always in the<lb/>face of the enemy and generally in small force. Our<lb/>responsibility was great both for men and property and<lb/>we were paid additionally for assuming it. I could not<lb/>think it right that I should retain my rank and com-<lb/>mission, receive the pay and stand in the way of those<lb/>below me, while I shoved onto them the danger and<lb/>responsibility, left my men to take care of themselves<lb/>and went off and enjoyed myself looking only to my<lb/>own advancement. This objection might however be<lb/>removed by my receiving a new commission as aid.<lb/>This he could not offer me, but even if he could, my<lb/>second objection would still be in the way. He knew<lb/>how essential in the cavalry officers of experience were<lb/>and I told him how in our regiment our officers had<lb/>been weeded out, so that now actually we could not<lb/>boast of one officer, considered really reliable, to each<lb/>of our four squadrons and that I was now the third line<lb/>officer in this part of the regiment. I could not tell him<lb/>of the sort of indirect appeal Curtis had made to me<lb/>a few days before when Clapp had decided to leave us.<lb/>I sustained Clapp in his course and said, that so far as<lb/>the good of the regiment was concerned no officer had<lb/>a right to consider himself so valuable to it that he<lb/>ought to stay. Curtis replied: "That is very well to<lb/>say, but you know the facts. You know whom we have<lb/>and you know that if I went, and Higginson went, and<lb/>yourself and one Captain more, the regiment would be<lb/>stripped of its reliable officers.

Did I pretend that I could be of<lb/>more use and service in this war on a staff than in my<lb/>present position? If so, he disagreed with me. Would<lb/>I allow myself to be driven from the post of usefulness</p><p>by a man as radically wrong and dangerous as ?</p><p>If so, he could not sympathize with me. Did I go into<lb/>this war as a soldier to enjoy and benefit myself or to<lb/>contribute all in my power to a great result?

He<lb/>argued in this way, and, while he preached, I felt that<lb/>he himself was living up to his doctrine. I knew that he<lb/>was the lif e and soul of this regiment, that he was doing<lb/>his share in the war in his place; that Sargent could not<lb/>drive him from it, and that he himself would not leave<lb/>it. I felt that among us all he was the one strong,<lb/>determined, formidable man. All this had its influence<lb/>on me. Four months ago I should have felt differently<lb/>and replied that there were better men than I here and<lb/>my loss will not be felt; but now they are so all gone<lb/>that I felt that the loss of each one was irreparable.</p><p/>

I hope I decided<lb/>wisely; I know I did honestly, unwillingly and accord-<lb/>ing to my lights. It will cost me all my comfort and<lb/>most of my pleasures; it may cost me my life, and that<lb/>too grossly blundered away.

He only expressed regret, as he assured me that<lb/>he had been in it and was well enough aware that<lb/>mine was the hardest, most trying and most thankless<lb/>branch of the service in existence. Colonel Williams,<lb/>he told me, had recommended me to him strongly and<lb/>had induced him to make the offer; but apart from all<lb/>I said he evidently considered that he rather offered<lb/>me a fall from a senior captaincy of cavalry to a posi-<lb/>tion as personal aid to a Brigadier.</p><p/>

			<p>280 A CYCLE OF ADAMS LETTERS [May i,</p><p>I left off by sending you the debate of last Friday<lb/>night which contained Earl Russell's brilliant re-<lb/>marks on the celebrated letter of our Minister to Ad-<lb/>miral Dupont. In those remarks Earl Russell was<lb/>indignant at the idea of his speaking to Mr. Adams<lb/>about it. No! No! He should go straight to Wash-<lb/>ington ! But my Lord, having thus pledged himself in<lb/>order to please the English copper-heads, to go straight<lb/>to Washington, amused himself the next morning by<lb/>sending straight to Mr. Adams. Of course I know<lb/>nothing of the conversation that followed. That is all<lb/>a secret with Mr. Seward. But I think it is not difficult<lb/>to guess. It had suited Lord Russell to yield a little to<lb/>the copper-head pressure on Thursday night; it suited<lb/>him to allow Mr. Adams to triumphantly purge him-<lb/>self of misdemeanor on Friday morning. It suited him<lb/>to make the American Minister think that he (Lord R.)<lb/>thought him to be in the wrong Ã¢ÂÂ moderately. It also<lb/>suited him to make the British public think that<lb/>Mr. Adams had confessed his error and contrition and<lb/>had received pardon.

It is reported that<lb/>Mr. Adams is conscious of having acted in the matter<lb/>upon imperfect representations and with undue haste,<lb/>and that consequently he raises no pretensions such as<lb/>would necessitate any absolute protest from one Gov-<lb/>ernment to the other on the subject. It is therefore<lb/>believed that the relations between our Cabinet and<lb/>the United States Legation in London will continue<lb/>on a friendly footing Ã¢ÂÂ a result which in a personal<lb/>sense will afford unmixed satisfaction, since the indi-<lb/>vidual and historical claims of Mr. Adams to respect<lb/>and esteem have never been disputed in any quarter."</p><p>Now, is not this a remarkable State Paper? Did you<lb/>ever see a case in which the butter was laid on so curi-<lb/>ously over the interstices of the bread? The real fact<lb/>is that you should read "Earl Russell" instead of<lb/>"Mr. Adams" in the fifth line. That would be the<lb/>correct thing.

I don't<lb/>know what the plan was, but I cannot think that it<lb/>included our crossing the river. The enemy had a few<lb/>pieces of artillery on the hills beyond and the sharp-<lb/>shooters lined both banks.

The little squall has passed and instead of press-<lb/>ing on the Minister, people here feel that Lord Russell<lb/>was in the wrong in his attack that I sent you some<lb/>weeks ago, and the Times has this week administered<lb/>a second pacify er in the shape of a flattering leader on<lb/>Mr. Adams' speech to the Trades Unions delegation.<lb/>I send you a newspaper containing this speech. No-<lb/>tice also the Royal Academy dinner and Lord Palmer-<lb/>ston's remarks. They are not political, but are a no-<lb/>ble specimen of lofty sentiment and brilliant rhetoric,<lb/>worthy of the experienced statesman to whose power<lb/>and wisdom this vast nation bows. And these men call<lb/>Seward shallow and weak!</p><p>A much quieter feeling and a partial reaction against<lb/>the blockade runners have generally prevailed here for<lb/>a week past. Our successes on the Mississippi, too, and<lb/>the direct advices from the South are having a quiet-<lb/>ing effect here on the public, and the Polish question is<lb/>becoming so grave that we are let up a little. On the<lb/>whole we have made progress this last week.</p><p/>

			<p>1863] A CYCLE OF ADAMS LETTERS 297</p><p>Meanwhile we have a complete Cabinet of Minis-<lb/>terial advisers and assistants. I wrote you their names<lb/>in my last. Of them all Mr. Evarts is the only one<lb/>whom I put very high. Dana too has written to call<lb/>on my services for him. So I have done and shall do<lb/>everything I can to make him comfortable and con-<lb/>tented. Last Sunday I took him down to Westminster<lb/>Abbey in the afternoon, where we listened awhile to<lb/>the services, and then trotted off and took a steamboat<lb/>up the river. We had a two hours' voyage up to Kew,<lb/>where we arrived at half after five, and had just time<lb/>to run over the gardens. Then we took a cab and<lb/>drove up to Richmond Hill, where we ordered dinner<lb/>at the Star and Garter, and then sat in the open air<lb/>and watched the view and the sunset until our meal<lb/>was ready. Much conversation had we, and that of a<lb/>pretty confidential nature. We discussed affairs at<lb/>home and philosophic statesmanship, the Government<lb/>and the possibility of effectual reform. He is much like<lb/>Dana in his views, but is evidently a good deal soured<lb/>by his political ill-luck.</p><p>Another evening I took him out to see London by<lb/>night. We visited, as spectators, various places of pop-<lb/>ular resort. He was much interested in them, and<lb/>seemed to enjoy the experience as a novelty in his<lb/>acquaintance with life. London is rather peculiar in<lb/>these respects, and even an experienced traveller would<lb/>find novelty in the study of character at the Argyll<lb/>Rooms and at Evans's. At any rate, I consider that<lb/>I have done my part there, and you may imagine that<lb/>I do not much neglect opportunities to conciliate men</p><p/>

I would like to<lb/>get further west, but the deuce of it is that there are<lb/>so few distinguished western men.</p><p>With this exception I believe the last week has been<lb/>quiet. I was rather astonished last Monday by one of<lb/>Seward's jocose proceedings. The Minister had sent<lb/>me down to the Trades Unions meeting three weeks<lb/>ago to make a report on it to him, for transmission to<lb/>Washington. I did so and wrote a report which I had no<lb/>time either to correct or alter, and which was sent the<lb/>next day to Seward officially, appended to a despatch.<lb/>Now Seward writes back as grave as a Prime Minister<lb/>a formal despatch acknowledging the other, and thank-<lb/>ing "Mr. Henry B. Adams " in stately and wordy para-<lb/>graphs for his report and "profound disquisition," etc.,<lb/>etc. I propose to write a note to Fred Seward on his<lb/>father's generosity. . . .</p><p>END OF VOLUME I</p><p/>
