				Preface
			</fw>
			<p>PREFACE</p><p>Thinking over my life, it has often occurred to me that<lb/>my children and their descendants might find it of inter-<lb/>est to know something about the life of their ancestor who<lb/>fought in the Civil War, just as I myself would give a<lb/>great deal if I had some story of my ancestors in the Rev-<lb/>olution. Accordingly I have gathered together from my<lb/>diary, which I kept during a greater portion of the War,<lb/>Ã¢ÂÂ some of which I lost, which made it, of course, un-<lb/>available, Ã¢ÂÂ also from letters written home to my father<lb/>and mother and sisters, facts which will interest my chil-<lb/>dren. I have added to it a brief account of the genealogy-<lb/>of the family so far as it is known, also some facts in my<lb/>father's life, and some in my own life not connected with<lb/>the War.</p><p>Altogether my life has been a varied and interesting one,<lb/>full of happiness and full of sorrow. Perhaps no fuller<lb/>than the lives of hundreds of other people; still I give<lb/>the account to my children for what it is worth, and hope<lb/>they will be repaid for the trouble of reading it. I have<lb/>left out a great many portions of my letters, as I real-<lb/>ize now that my ideas then were often \er&amp;gt;- fault\- and<lb/>wide of the mark, and that conclusions that I arrived at<lb/>then are hardly worth printing now. My children reading<lb/>the war diary must remember that I was only twenty<lb/>years old when I went into the \\'ar, that I had graduated<lb/>from Har\-ard when I was eighteen, and was still vers*<lb/>young, and must make allowances for opinions expressed<lb/>in my letters as being those of a very young man, Ã¢ÂÂ almost<lb/>a boy.</p><p/>

			<p>WAR DIARY AND LETTERS<lb/>OF STEPHEN M. WELD</p><p>CHAPTER I</p><p>INTRODUCTORY Ã¢ÂÂ THE WELD FAMILY Ã¢ÂÂ COLLEGE LIFE</p><p>I WISH that during my lifetime, at least, this book<lb/>should be kept strictly private. There are many re-<lb/>marks about people who are perhaps now living, or whose<lb/>near relatives may be living, which I should omit if the<lb/>book were to be made public property by publishing it.<lb/>Furthermore, there are several laudatory letters which it<lb/>is right and proper and very pleasant to have my de-<lb/>scendants read, but which it would be in exceedingly bad<lb/>taste for me to publish or give out in any book for general<lb/>circulation. After I am dead it will be no matter who<lb/>sees it Ã¢ÂÂ perhaps no one will care about reading it.</p><p>I think to my grandchildren particularly, and to their<lb/>children, it may be interesting to read of what will be to<lb/>them the earlier times of the Republic; and it may help<lb/>them to realize how important it is for them to support<lb/>the form of government which their ancestors fought so<lb/>hard to keep alive and to sustain in time of trouble. I am<lb/>going to give a short sketch of my life before the War,<lb/>and also some of the, to me, most important matters that<lb/>had a bearing on the making or marring of my life up to<lb/>the time of my seventy-first year. On my last birthday,<lb/>the fourth of January, 19 12, I was seventy years old.</p><p>As being of interest to my descendants, I propose to<lb/>insert here an article written by the Reverend Andrew</p><p/>

			<p>4 WAR DIARY AND LETTERS OF</p><p>P. Peabody, Plummer Professor at Harvard, and a class-<lb/>mate of my father's, and printed by him in his volume,<lb/>Harvard Graduates Whom I Have Known.^</p><p>STEPHEN MINOT WELD</p><p>1826</p><p>If the members of my class had been asked at any time who<lb/>of the class was more beloved than any other, I suppose that<lb/>every one of them would have answered, "Stephen Weld."<lb/>I do not mean that he was popular, in the vulgar sense of that<lb/>term. He had none of the traits, arts, or ways by which one<lb/>wins that title. He united, to a degree which I have seldom or<lb/>never known beside, the simplicity of a child, the exuberant<lb/>mirthfulness of an untamed boy, and the thoroughly formed<lb/>manliness of spirit which could resist evil, surmount obstacles,<lb/>and make a hopeful beginning of a vigorous life work. I doubt<lb/>whether the Faculty loved him; and yet such a person as he<lb/>would be a prime favorite with the present Faculty, so entirely<lb/>has the pervading spirit of the college regime been revolution-<lb/>ized. He was full of fun and frolic, and no one enjoyed as he<lb/>did a practical joke, when it could do no harm. His laugh was<lb/>joy-giving, and I seem to hear it as I write. Though not irreg-<lb/>ular in attendance on college exercises, I doubt whether he<lb/>studied much till his Senior year. Yet it was perfectly well<lb/>understood that he all along had possessed the capacity and<lb/>taste which he then began to show, and which were sure to<lb/>make him an excellent scholar whenever he gave his mind to the<lb/>work. We all recognized in him not only good-nature and good-<lb/>fellowship, but a thorough nobleness of spirit and character,<lb/>inborn and inbred. We should have gone to him to take<lb/>the lead on any gay or festive occasion; but we should have<lb/>gone to him equally for sympathy under adverse circumstan-<lb/>ces, or for help which could be rendered only with labor and<lb/>sacrifice.</p><p>Stephen Minot Weld was born in Boston in 1806. His father,</p><p>1 Boston: Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co., 1890.</p><p/>

			<p>STEPHEN M. WELD 5</p><p>William Gordon Weld, was an enterprising and for many<lb/>years a successful ship-master and ship-owner, and distin-<lb/>guished himself by defeating some Algerine pirates who at-<lb/>tacked him, and capturing two of their vessels. Subsequently,<lb/>in our War of 18 12, a vessel of his, under his own command,<lb/>with a valuable cargo and a large amount of specie, was cap-<lb/>tured by a British frigate off Boston harbor. He had become,<lb/>by the standard of the times, a rich man, but was so no longer.<lb/>Several years before this loss, he had removed to Lancaster,<lb/>and there Stephen was fitted for college, in the school of which<lb/>I have already spoken. He must have commenced his prepara-<lb/>tions under the tuition of George B. Emerson.</p><p>He entered college at sixteen years of age, without the initial<lb/>experience of the outside world which a boy gets by attending<lb/>school away from home. He came with exuberant spirits, with<lb/>a proclivity for play rather than for work, and with a mirth-<lb/>provoking power that made him a favorite with the least in-<lb/>dustrious of his class, while his ingenuousness, his moral purity,<lb/>and his keen sense of honor won the esteem and afifection of<lb/>those of the opposite type. His father died at the close of his<lb/>Junior year. From that time he evidently thought more of the<lb/>future and of his responsibilities in and for it than he had be-<lb/>fore. He became more studious, and his college work in the<lb/>Senior year was in every respect creditable. He determined<lb/>to be a teacher, and felt the necessity of first being a learner.<lb/>During that and the following year, if my memory serves me<lb/>aright, he reviewed with care the studies required for admission<lb/>to college.</p><p>On graduating, Mr. Weld was employed for one year as an<lb/>assistant teacher in the long-estabhshed boarding-school of<lb/>Mr. Greene, at Jamaica Plain. In the following year he opened<lb/>a similar school in the immediate neighborhood of Mr. Greene's.<lb/>His mother joined him in the enterprise, taking charge of the<lb/>housekeeping, and performing her full part in making for the<lb/>boys under their united care not only a comfortable home, but<lb/>one on which they always looked back with pleasure and grati-<lb/>tude. She had several younger children to be educated. Of her</p><p/>

Weld was already in business, yet with<lb/>no more than the remote prospect of the wealth which he<lb/>afterward obtained, and he did everything in his power to eke<lb/>out her slender income; forming habits of personal self-denial<lb/>which lasted for life, in thus meeting the calls of filial duty.<lb/>As Stephen prospered, he of course came to share in this work<lb/>with his brother ; for there never was a time when for him the<lb/>chief happiness of possessing was not the privilege of bestowing.<lb/>His school grew rapidly in numbers and in reputation, and it<lb/>is hardly too much to say that its reputation was national ; for<lb/>pupils came to it from every part of the country, and even from<lb/>Cuba, Mexico, and Yucatan. It continued in undiminished<lb/>success, till at the end of thirty years Mr. Weld thought him-<lb/>self entitled to the only rest which a man ever ought to seek Ã¢ÂÂ<lb/>a change of work.</p><p>In this case the change was not rest. In 1858 Mr. Weld was<lb/>chosen president of the Metropolitan Railroad Company, then<lb/>in its infancy; but he suffered so severely from overwork in the<lb/>complicated affairs of the company, that he felt compelled to<lb/>resign the office in the following year. The only political offices<lb/>which he ever held were as a member of the Executive Council<lb/>under Governors Clifford and Emory Washburn, and as pre-<lb/>sidential elector in 1864.</p><p>During the War of the Rebellion Mr. Weld was second to no<lb/>one in the country's service, giving time, money, counsel, and<lb/>effort unsparingly, and always with a sound discretion that<lb/>largely enhanced the value of whatever he gave or did. He was<lb/>recognized by the citizens of West Roxbury as foremost in pa-<lb/>triotic devotion among those at home or in the field, the living<lb/>or the dead. Had he been a younger man, I know that he would<lb/>have enlisted for active duty, and it was in his spirit and under<lb/>his strong encouragement, that his eldest son, bearing his<lb/>name (H. U. i860), entered the army, in which he held an im-<lb/>portant command with distinguished honor.</p><p>Mr. Weld was for nine years, and at the time of his death,<lb/>one of the Overseers of the College, and among all its alumni<lb/>there was not one more devoted to its best interests.

Weld, to meet us,<lb/>for the purpose of enlisting him in some enterprise for the ben-<lb/>efit of the College. What that enterprise should be, was the<lb/>subject of the evening's talk. The result was that Mr. Weld<lb/>determined to erect a building, which should at once meet the<lb/>actual need of a new dormitory and yield a fair interest on its<lb/>value as an investment. In accordance with this purpose, he<lb/>procured plans and estimates, and would have gone on with<lb/>the building had not the War intervened. When the project<lb/>was renewed, Stephen was no longer living, and Weld Hall is<lb/>his brother's tribute to his memory.</p><p>Mr. Weld was generous and kind, not only in special chan-<lb/>nels of beneficence, but in every form and way. He never lost<lb/>an opportunity of doing good, and no man could have been<lb/>more ingenious and inventive than he was in discovering and<lb/>creating such opportunities. It was said that in Jamaica Plain<lb/>there could not be found an individual who had not in some way<lb/>been indebted to him for good offices-, and none that needed<lb/>pecuniary help by loan or gift that had not received it from him.<lb/>He died in 1867, after a short and painful illness, during which<lb/>he was fully aware of its inevitably fatal issue, which he met<lb/>with entire calmness and resignation. I was one of the officiat-<lb/>ing clergy at his funeral. The large church was crowded; and<lb/>of the many occasions of the kind that I have witnessed, I have<lb/>never seen one at which there were such tokens of profound<lb/>sorrow in the entire assembly. The whole community were in<lb/>mourning for a man who had been every one's friend, and<lb/>whom every one had loved.</p><p>A few anecdotes which I used to hear from my father<lb/>about his youth may not come in amiss here. When he<lb/>lived at Lancaster he had to go some two miles every<lb/>day to school, winter and summer. In doing so he had<lb/>to cross the Nashua River, and as there was no bridge, he<lb/>and his brothers crossed in an old boat. He used to tell</p><p/>

For in-<lb/>stance, my mock part was, "S. M. Weld will display his<lb/>big feet [feat]." Another classmate, the sitting-down part<lb/>of whose body was very large, was introduced by the<lb/>quotation from Shakespeare, " I will a round, unvarnished<lb/>tale [tail] deliver." Another man, who was rather penu-<lb/>rious, had the mock part, "Though on pleasure he was<lb/>bent, he had a frugal mind." I remember that in the class<lb/>ahead of me William Swan, who was accustomed to wear<lb/>a beaver (which was rather unusual), and Ames, who<lb/>was very attentive to Miss Felton, were introduced in<lb/>this way: "Swan with his beaver, and Ames with his<lb/>felt on [Felton] will appear in this procession."

			<p>20 WAR DIARY AND LETTERS OF</p><p>a Mr. Smalley In Jamaica Plain. The times were quite<lb/>stirring then. The Anti-Slavery party was very strong,<lb/>and feeling was running exceedingly high between the<lb/>North and the South. I was very anxious to go to the<lb/>War, but my father was unwilling, feeling that I ought to<lb/>stay at home and study.</p><p>As far back as I can remember, my father was a Whig,<lb/>and during the contest between Douglas, Breckenridge<lb/>and Lincoln, in which Lincoln was elected, he was for<lb/>Bell and Everett. Although not of age, I took sides with<lb/>the Republicans and did what I could to help elect Lin-<lb/>coln. The feeling was intensely bitter. It was very<lb/>marked among the students at Harvard who came from<lb/>the South, they being strongly in favor of slavery and<lb/>the doctrine of State's Rights. After the attack on Fort<lb/>Sumter the feeling at the Somerset Club was intense<lb/>against any man who took command of a negro regiment.<lb/>Nothing compared to this in intensity of feeling has ex-<lb/>isted at any other time in my life, and it is hard for any<lb/>one nowadays to understand the bitterness which existed<lb/>then. My father during the War was a strong Repub-<lb/>lican and did all he could to further the cause of the<lb/>North. The Northerners who sympathized with the<lb/>South were called "copperheads" and the feeling against<lb/>them was more bitter, if possible, than against the<lb/>Southerners.</p><p>While in the Law School, I had a room on Brattle<lb/>Street, Cambridge, with Dr. John G. Perry.</p><p>The following pages from my diary give perhaps a<lb/>better account of my start in the army than anything<lb/>which I could now write. I have adhered closely to the<lb/>wording of my diary as I then wrote it, and have not<lb/>endeavored to improve the language or construction, as<lb/>I think it will give a much better idea of what I really</p><p/>

About 12 we<lb/>came in sight of the Rip Raps, and soon after of Fortress<lb/>Monroe. The Rip Raps, a few miles off, look like a mass<lb/>of stones dumped down in a heap, and on coming nearer<lb/>to them, one finds that the opinion he formed of them at<lb/>first sight was correct. They embrace perhaps an acre<lb/>and a half to two acres, and are formed entirely of granite<lb/>rocks dropped in utter disorder and confusion into the<lb/>middle of Hampton Roads, and at about a mile and a<lb/>half from Fortress Monroe. There are one or two small<lb/>houses on it for laborers, but a more desolate hole I can-<lb/>not imagine. The fortress itself cannot be seen until you<lb/>are quite near it, on account of the shore being so low.<lb/>We could see only two sides of it from the sea, the houses<lb/>and trees on the shore hiding the rest of it. I saw the<lb/>famous Sewall's Point for the ilrst time. The batteries<lb/>are not visible, being on the other side of the point. The<lb/>masts of our ships at Newport News could also be seen,<lb/>some 8 miles distant. We left our ship, the Ocean Express,<lb/>here, and turned round and started for Annapolis, where<lb/>we were to take our troops on board.

We landed at<lb/>the Naval School, and found the grounds full of troops,<lb/>etc. The 21st Massachusetts, Colonel Morse, is stationed<lb/>here, but I had no chance to see any of the officers. The<lb/>grounds of the Naval School are quite spacious, and face<lb/>the Chesapeake on one side, and the river Severn on the<lb/>other. The buildings are of brick and quite substantial,<lb/>though by no means handsome. Right on the water is a<lb/>round building with guns mounted, which was used for the<lb/>middies to practice in. On the right of this battery a long<lb/>pier runs out into the river, and at the end of it, the Con-<lb/>stitution was anchored. Uncle Oliver told me that when<lb/>he came here last April, the rebels were erecting a battery<lb/>on the other side of the river, and about an eighth of a<lb/>mile distant, to destroy the Constitution. His timely ar-<lb/>rival, however, put an end to their villainous schemes, by<lb/>taking the ship and school away. The professors' houses<lb/>were built in a row on the right side of the ground.</p><p>Having procured a pass, we got outside the grounds,<lb/>and into the city, the cJipital of Maryland. The streets<lb/>were in a terrible state from the rain, which made a hor-<lb/>rible clayey sort of mud, much to the detriment of our<lb/>shoes, which were soon covered with a good coat of this<lb/>Maryland blacking. We finally came out on a street<lb/>which was roughly paved and which led us to the post-<lb/>office and the hotel. I inquired for letters, but found<lb/>none, and was consequently much disappointed. The<lb/>next place I visited was the State House. It stands on a<lb/>hill, the highest one in the town, and has a green around<lb/>it. From this green the streets all diverge, making a sort<lb/>of cobweb. On entering the State House, I was saluted<lb/>by a young boy about ten years old, who was smoking a<lb/>cigar, and who seemed to think himself the owner of the<lb/>place.

On first entering<lb/>the House, the visitor sees the arms of the State staring<lb/>him in the face, and the motto, "Crescite et multipli-<lb/>camini," written under them. The city, however, belies<lb/>the motto as far as I could see, for it looks as if it had not<lb/>increased for a century, but had stood still, and as if all<lb/>its inhabitants and buildings had been enjoying a cent-<lb/>ury's rest. From the cupola I had a most magnificent<lb/>view, and one which well repaid me for the trouble I had<lb/>in getting ashore. Close around me was the town, with<lb/>its quaint, old-fashioned houses, with gables and over-<lb/>hanging roofs, many covered with moss, and, in some<lb/>cases, plants growing from the eaves. It was more like a<lb/>view of an old-fashioned English town which one often<lb/>sees painted on canvas in stage-scenery. Then beyond<lb/>the town were fertile fields, with crops ready for gather-<lb/>ing, and every little way, a beautiful hillock rising up,<lb/>with splendid trees growing there, and the river winding<lb/>among them, now sparkling like a silver cord, and now<lb/>hidden from the sight. Then again, the white tents of the<lb/>soldiers would peep out from the dark green of the trees,<lb/>and what at first sight seemed a long fence, but on<lb/>closer inspection proved to be the troops going through<lb/>their dress-parade, would meet one's view. The sight was<lb/>a most beautiful one, and one which I cannot describe.<lb/>The rivers on both sides of the city, with their steep<lb/>banks thickly wooded, and winding so prettily among<lb/>the hills, were in themselves a sufhcient compensation for<lb/>the climb up to the cupola. Then looking out on the<lb/>Chesapeake and seeing over twenty steamers, in addi-<lb/>tion to a large number of small craft quietly at anchor in<lb/>the bay, and the long blue shore of Virginia opposite,</p><p/>

Finally, about eight<lb/>o'clock P.M. they came, and to my disappointment I found<lb/>they were the 4th New Hampshire regiment, as I hoped<lb/>to see some Massachusetts troops. Church, the reporter<lb/>of the New York Sun, and Green of the Boston Journal<lb/>came on board.</p><p>Sunday, October 20. Ã¢ÂÂ This day passed like any other,<lb/>except perhaps it was a more busy one. The baggage of<lb/>the regiment was put on board, and we started on our<lb/>way for Fortress Monroe at noon. We steamed down the<lb/>Chesapeake, and came in sight of the Capes, when we<lb/>had to anchor owing to a fog and a storm. I received a<lb/>letter from John Perry, much to my delight, as he is the<lb/>only one I have heard from.</p><p>Monday, October 21.

My<lb/>chum refuses to have the window open, and the conse-<lb/>quence is we have more foul air in the room than is pleas-<lb/>ant for me. I was soon well, however, after getting on<lb/>deck, although I carefully and secretly looked over the rail-<lb/>ing into the sea, and gave Davy Jones a scanty offering.<lb/>It was amusing to see the soldiers sick and vomiting, espe-<lb/>cially after I was well.

As nothing particularly<lb/>interesting happened while we were here, I shall just<lb/>jot down a few events interesting to myself only. I went<lb/>ashore and walked all over the fortress, and all around<lb/>the walls. There is a ditch all around the fort, and on<lb/>some sides a water battery on the outside of it. There is<lb/>one tier of guns in casemates, and one en barbette. On the<lb/>sea side, outside of the walls, is the Floyd gun mounted,<lb/>and the Union gun ready to mount, both of them remark-<lb/>able only on account of their size. The fort is connected<lb/>with the mainland by two sandy necks of land, between<lb/>which is a large body of water which has access to the<lb/>ocean by a channel running through one of these necks,<lb/>and over which a new bridge has lately been built. This<lb/>last-named neck is the one by which they go to Hampton<lb/>and the mainland. The interior of the fort is quite pretty,<lb/>trees growing there, and walks being laid out very much<lb/>like a park. There are several houses here, and also a<lb/>church. A man might make himself very comfortable<lb/>here, in my opinion.</p><p>I walked over to the place where most of our troops<lb/>are encamped, which lies between Hampton and the<lb/>fort, and which is approached by the neck before referred<lb/>to. I went to the camp of the i6th Massachusetts, and<lb/>saw Waldo Merriam, the adjutant, and Bill Amory of<lb/>Jamaica Plain. I had a very pleasant time, and was de-<lb/>lighted to see old faces again. I saw a very good dress-<lb/>parade, and returned to the fort again, passing through<lb/>the camp of the Naval Brigade, Colonel Wardrop. I<lb/>spent the night at the Hygeia Hotel, most of which is<lb/>used as a hospital for our troops. Just as I had gone to<lb/>sleep I was waked up by the most fearful succession of<lb/>screams I ever heard in my life.

I was well paid, too, for a more beautiful<lb/>and clean-looking ship I never saw. The decks looked<lb/>clean enough to eat one's meal off of, and the long line of<lb/>guns on each side, all polished and in perfect order,<lb/>seemed eager to bestow a few compliments on any rebel<lb/>or enemy who might make his appearance. Hubbell<lb/>went with me, and was also much pleased with the ship.<lb/>I saw Captain Van Brunt ^ on board, looking as well as<lb/>ever.</p><p>We waited here at Hampton Roads for a week, anx-<lb/>iously expecting orders to sail, and growing at times de-<lb/>spondent and gloomy about the success of the expedi-<lb/>tion. Then, to make us still more gloomy, reports were<lb/>flying about of the desertion of the commodore's pri-<lb/>vate secretary, with important papers, containing the<lb/>secret naval signals, our place of destination, etc. To<lb/>crown the whole, and plunge us still deeper into despair,<lb/>we heard of the battle of Ball's Bluff, and of the defeat<lb/>of our forces. The news of Putnam's death, of Holmes^<lb/>being wounded, etc., made me feel the reality of the war,<lb/>which is a hard thing to bring home to one's self until<lb/>one loses a friend, or meets with some such mishap.<lb/>However, as the ships began to get up steam, and as vari-<lb/>ous other little matters showed that we were going to<lb/>start soon, our fears and despondent feelings began to<lb/>give way to a more cheerful state of mind, and when<lb/>we were actually under way every one felt buoyant and<lb/>hopeful. While waiting here, one of the 7th Connecti-<lb/>cut soldiers was drowned by jumping overboard for a<lb/>plate which we had dropped.

Last night we<lb/>steamed out towards the sea about four miles, and then<lb/>anchored. This morning I was waked up about 6 o'clock<lb/>by the moving of the paddle-wheels. By the time I was<lb/>up and dressed, which was about 8 o'clock, I found that<lb/>we had at last fastened our tow-line to the Ocean Ex-<lb/>press, and about ten we started slowly on our way, with<lb/>the most delightful weather imaginable, the air being<lb/>warmer than it had been for some days previous, and<lb/>the sea being moderately calm. When we passed Cape<lb/>Henry we could see the lighthouse standing up boldly on<lb/>a barren sand-hill, and no signs of civilization visible<lb/>except two small huts, situated at the foot of the light-<lb/>house. To make the place seem still more desolate than<lb/>nature had made it, a wrecked schooner could be plainly<lb/>seen about half a mile from the lighthouse, a monument<lb/>of the wickedness of these rebels who destroy lighthouses<lb/>as well as try to destroy their government. The cape is a<lb/>barren, desolate spot, with high sand-hills rising up in the<lb/>background, and gradually decreasing in size until they<lb/>terminate in a narrow sand-spit. We passed within two<lb/>miles, and might easily have been disabled by a battery<lb/>placed there. The sight of so many vessels leaving the<lb/>port at once, with different-colored flags on their masts<lb/>as signals or to denote their names, was a most beautiful<lb/>one. When we had passed the cape, our tow-line parted,<lb/>repairing which delayed us about an hour. We finally got<lb/>off at two o'clock, proceeding as slowly as possible all the<lb/>afternoon, in order to keep with the rest of the fleet.</p><p>The sea was pretty rough all the day, but most of the<lb/>ships stood it well except the ferry-boats.

I spoke<lb/>to Captain Hascall about getting me a place on General<lb/>Wright's ^ staff as volunteer aide. A society was formed<lb/>for the "confusion of useless knowledge" the other even-<lb/>ing, and we had a meeting this evening.</p><p>Wednesday, October 30. Ã¢ÂÂ The day was beautiful and<lb/>pleasant. The air was soft and balmy, as we had just<lb/>struck the Gulf Stream, and the temperature of the water<lb/>was 74 degrees. We had to go as slowly as possible, as we<lb/>did yesterday, in order to keep with the rest of the fleet.<lb/>The fleet kept nearer each other, and in better order than<lb/>yesterday. According to the pilot we were off Cape Hat-<lb/>teras at 2 p.m. We found out however, as events showed,<lb/>that we did not take sufficient account of our slow rate of<lb/>speed, and of the Gulf Stream. Nothing of any particu-<lb/>lar interest occurred during the day. I saw nothing of the<lb/>ferry-boats. It was so rough that some of them must have<lb/>gone in nearer to the shore.</p><p>Thursday, October 31. Ã¢ÂÂ This morning about 2.30<lb/>o'clock I was waked up by the ship's shaking, jarring,<lb/>groaning, and screeching generally. I at first thought<lb/>we had been struck by a heavy sea, but a second shock,<lb/>following soon after the first, convinced me that I was<lb/>wrong. At the second shock I called Saxton and asked<lb/>him what the matter was, and we both jumped out of<lb/>bed, I running into the saloon to see what had happened,<lb/>and Saxton lighting the candle. The saloon was full of<lb/>people, excited and running around, but still not noisy.<lb/>I found out from the hospital steward that the ship was<lb/>aground. All the while we were bumping heavily, caus-<lb/>ing the ship to groan and creak in every timber. I must<lb/>confess that a dreadful shudder ran through me at the</p><p>^ General Horatio G.

I thought, however, that it would do no<lb/>good to be frightened, so I put on my trousers, shoes,<lb/>and coat, then took my watch and ring from under my<lb/>pillow, and finally took the cork life-preserver from under<lb/>the bed, and fixed it so that I could slip it on at a min-<lb/>ute's notice. I then left it on my bed, and went up on<lb/>deck to see how we were getting on. When I reached the<lb/>deck, the bumping had ceased, and the ship had backed<lb/>off safely. The pumps were sounded, and everything<lb/>found snug and tight, much to my delight as well as that<lb/>of others.</p><p>When we struck, the concussion was so severe as to<lb/>throw several people out of their berths, and those on<lb/>deck were thrown several feet. We sent up rockets as<lb/>signals of distress, and as a warning to other vessels of the<lb/>fleet. Pretty soon the Coatzacoalcos came along, and<lb/>asked us if we wanted any assistance. We told her we<lb/>were all right, and she then informed us that the Illinois<lb/>had also grounded, but had got ofi without injury. She<lb/>had been obliged to cut loose the ship which she was tow-<lb/>ing, which we also had to do, our ship barely grazing our<lb/>starboard wheelhouse. We backed for some distance, and<lb/>then steered due East. I went to bed at four and slept till<lb/>six, when I got up and dressed myself. I saw our ship,<lb/>the Ocean Express, on our port bow, and about ten<lb/>o'clock we fastened our tow line to her.</p><p>In regard to the behavior of the passengers of the ship,<lb/>I think it should be praised as a general thing. Most of<lb/>them were calm and quiet, although some of them made<lb/>fools of themselves. Captain Comstock says we had a<lb/>very narrow escape indeed, one of the most wonderful<lb/>on record.

No<lb/>one seemed to know what shoal we struck, although it<lb/>afterwards turned out to be the Outer Hatteras Shoal.<lb/>There must have been some gross negligence, to say the<lb/>least, in our getting on the shoal, and from all I can learn,<lb/>the Wabash was to blame, as she at ten last evening gave<lb/>us the course to steer, which we followed strictly, and<lb/>consequently ran aground. Hubbell and the second mate,<lb/>Hallet, saw breakers ahead about three minutes before<lb/>we struck and told the captain of it. He said it was im-<lb/>possible, and was just going forward when she struck.<lb/>The captain says the waves were as high as the yards, and<lb/>that the shoal must have been steep and precipitous<lb/>on its sides as otherwise we should have struck amidships,<lb/>and been "hogged." Lieutenant Richardson, the ofificer<lb/>of the day, behaved nobly. He told all the sentinels to<lb/>do their duty, and stick the first man who came up, while<lb/>he stood at the head of the stairs with a loaded pistol,<lb/>and told them he would shoot the first, man who tried to<lb/>pass him. The captain was thus enabled to work the ship<lb/>easily, which would have been impossible with all the<lb/>soldiers on deck.</p><p>We saw the Illinois with one smoke-stack broken off<lb/>by her ship running into her, but she has now repaired it.<lb/>The fleet is either all scattered or else we are away from it,<lb/>and the latter proves to be the case. I should think that<lb/>more than two vessels must have struck the shoal. The<lb/>war-steamer Bienville, blockading off Hatteras Inlet,<lb/>chased us this morning to ask if we had seen the Wabash.<lb/>The Bienville also said she went ashore last night on the<lb/>same shoal. In the afternoon the Atlantic spoke us,<lb/>steaming back to hurry up the rest of the fleet. She said<lb/>the Wabash was ahead of us, much to our gratification as<lb/>we were afraid that a great part of the fleet had been lost</p><p/>

Ã¢ÂÂ There was a rainbow early this<lb/>morning, and the old adage that "a rainbow in the morn-<lb/>ing is the sailor's warning" was well carried out; for<lb/>about ten o'clock it clouded up, and in an hour we had a<lb/>strong breeze blowing, which soon turned into a gale. It<lb/>blew hard all night, and I surely thought we were going<lb/>to the bottom. One sea which broke over the ship killed<lb/>one of Captain Hascall's horses. I did not go below dur-<lb/>ing the whole night. I am afraid the Governor and some<lb/>other vessels are lost. We parted with our tow this even-<lb/>ing. I never passed such a horrible night in my life. I had<lb/>fully made up my mind to be drowned, but suspense<lb/>was dreadful. The wind would blow and shriek through<lb/>the rigging till it seemed as if it could blow no harder;<lb/>and when I thought it was at its height, it would scream<lb/>and whistle more than ever. There was something terri-<lb/>ble to me in the waves, which were enormously high, and<lb/>only rendered visible by the phosphorescent light on the<lb/>tops of them. At times it would rain so that one could<lb/>not see, and the gangways would be full of water dashing<lb/>hither and thither with the motion of the ship, until it<lb/>seemed as if we were full of water and were going to sink<lb/>immediately. The drum-major of the regiment exhibited<lb/>such cowardice that it was disgusting to see him. I was<lb/>glad to see daylight as the sea grew calmer. We were in<lb/>Long, yj^ 53' and Lat. 33ÃÂ° 01' at noon.</p><p>Saturday, November 2. Ã¢ÂÂ The storm continued all day,<lb/>but it reached its height last night between 12 and 3, so<lb/>that to-day towards evening it moderated a little. Many<lb/>of the people were seasick, and I myself barely escaped<lb/>being so. In the afternoon we steered west, in the direc-<lb/>tion of Brunswick, Georgia. We lay to most of the night.</p><p/>

I think it must have been Tybee<lb/>Island at the entrance of Savannah River. The pilot will<lb/>not say where we are. There is an island on the extreme<lb/>right with what looks like a lighthouse on it. We had a<lb/>very good sermon from the chaplain this morning, and<lb/>afterwards the colonel addressed the soldiers in regard<lb/>to their sending home their pay. The chaplain in his<lb/>sermon hit the drum-major very well. He told the men to<lb/>avoid snivellers and cowards, etc. Our ship was the first<lb/>one to get here, followed by the Daniel Webster, and now<lb/>five are in sight. It is a clear, cool day. I think from what<lb/>the pilot says that the land we saw this morning must<lb/>have been off Port Royal Sound, which leads to Beaufort.<lb/>We saw 19 vessels in all this afternoon, none of them<lb/>war vessels, however. We are now drifting along at the<lb/>rate of half a mile an hour, and are within 20 miles of<lb/>land.

On our way<lb/>back we were spoken by the sloop-of-war Dale, which is<lb/>blockading here. She had her guns double-shotted and<lb/>would have fired at us if we had not stopped. We reached<lb/>our old place at 2 p.m. and found that all the fleet had<lb/>gone over the bar, and were five miles nearer shore than<lb/>before. We saw the Ericsson fast on the bar. We waited<lb/>here until 6 p.m., and as no message came for us in regard<lb/>to the channel, we had to put to sea again. We were<lb/>passed by the R. B.

			<p>STEPHEN M. WELD 39</p><p>started off at 9.30 o'clock for the anchorage of the other<lb/>ships. We had to proceed slowly and cautiously, for we<lb/>drew 22 feet of water, and at low tide there is not more<lb/>than three fathoms according to the chart. Just as we<lb/>started we saw the Wabash and the gunboats getting<lb/>under weigh, and heading for the Sound. It was a most<lb/>exciting moment for every one, as we expected to see the<lb/>smoke from the rebel cannon every second, announcing<lb/>that the fight which we had so longed for and on the suc-<lb/>cess of which so much depended, had begun in reality.</p><p>When we were about six miles from the land, we saw<lb/>the white smoke curling up in the air from a point on the<lb/>left of the sound called Hilton Head. This was followed<lb/>by the hea\^ " boom " of the report, and by several more<lb/>cannon fired from two batteries on the opposite side and<lb/>from rebel gunboats in the Sound. W^e, of course, were<lb/>very much excited and watched the proceedings with<lb/>great earnestness. The Wabash soon gave the rebels a<lb/>broadside, to which they responded briskly. Finally we<lb/>dropped our anchor about two miles and a half from shore,<lb/>and just out of the reach of their batteries. Here we could<lb/>get a fine view of the whole fight, our ship being the near-<lb/>est one of the transports.</p><p>During the first of the fight the rebel batteries on both<lb/>points fired quite vigorously, but the one in Bay Point<lb/>soon ceased firing except at intervals, either because our<lb/>ships were out of range, or because they were disabled.<lb/>It was probably from the first reason, as our ships during<lb/>the whole fight paid more attention to the Hilton Head<lb/>battery than to any other. The ships would go round in<lb/>an ellipse, firing at each battery as they passed it. At<lb/>first they went within 800 yards of Hilton Head, but the<lb/>second time round they approached within 600 yards.<lb/>The scene was a truly magnificent one. The Wabash</p><p/>

During the whole of the fight I could<lb/>see shot strike the water, sending a fountain up in the air<lb/>some 15 or 20 feet high. They would drop on all sides<lb/>of some of the vessels, but not many seemed to hit. The<lb/>second time the Wabash came round was well worth<lb/>travelling a thousand miles to see. She looked like a cloud<lb/>of smoke and flame, so incessant a fire did she keep up.<lb/>Then, at the same time, the gunboats increased the rapid-<lb/>ity of their fire, so that the fort was pretty well rained<lb/>upon. From the water's edge, where some of the shot<lb/>struck, to the woods two miles back of the fort, the air was<lb/>filled with rings of smoke, and with dust and dirt. Around<lb/>the fort it was terrific. I counted over 50 shells bursting<lb/>at once in and close around it. So thick was the air with<lb/>dust and smoke from the shells, that frequently the fort<lb/>would be hidden from sight. This would continue for<lb/>about 15 or 20 minutes, when the Wabash would haul off,<lb/>and go on her rounds to the other battery, letting fly a few<lb/>shot at it. The woods behind the fort were well shelled,<lb/>and if any rebels were there, they must have suffered<lb/>severely.</p><p>By the time the Wabash left on her second round, four<lb/>of our gunboats had taken up a position where they could<lb/>enfilade the rebel batteries, which they did in a handsome<lb/>manner. When the Wabash went at her work for the<lb/>third time, a little steam-tug, the Mercury, with a 20-<lb/>pound Parrott rifled gun, ran right up to the battery, and<lb/>got in so near they could not hit her. Then she backed<lb/>round with her stern towards the fort and let drive her one</p><p/>

At<lb/>3 o'clock the general and his staff got into a boat and<lb/>shoved off from the Baltic, and went to the Illinois, where<lb/>we found the 7th Connecticut embarking in boats. Soon<lb/>the Winfield Scott took about 50 of these boats in tow,<lb/>carrying them as near the shore as she could go.

It could hardly be avoided though, owing to<lb/>the manner in which the soldiers were landed : they being<lb/>in small boats and easily getting scattered, it was a work<lb/>of much difficulty getting them together again. General<lb/>Wright soon got his brigade together, and immediately<lb/>garrisoned the fort and stationed pickets, and posted all<lb/>the regiments, making them sleep on their arms, ready<lb/>at a minute's notice. He took me with him at about two<lb/>o'clock in the morning, and went the rounds. I got about<lb/>an hour's sleep in the headquarters, and was glad enough<lb/>to get it. I was so busy most of the time that I had no<lb/>chance to get any plunder, and then too the general was<lb/>going round, stopping the men from plundering, and of<lb/>course under such circumstances I did not wish to do it.<lb/>Many of the marines got swords, pistols, guns, watches,<lb/>etc., from the tents. It was quite a pretty sight in the<lb/>evening, when the moon had gone down, to see over a<lb/>hundred fires burning in every direction, and groups of<lb/>soldiers round them, talking, smoking, and joking as if<lb/>safe at home. The rebels left one of the guns in the fort<lb/>all loaded and ready to fire, and from many such signs<lb/>it would seem as if they must have left in quite a hurry.</p><p/>

This morning when<lb/>going to the ship I saw an explosion at the battery on the<lb/>other side, which I since learn was a mine.

I am occupying for a day or<lb/>two Lieutenant Monteith's tent, he being absent in<lb/>Washington, and am not quite settled yet. I shall make<lb/>preparations to stay here for a fortnight at least, as we<lb/>cannot advance before that time, and hardly under a<lb/>month's time. General Porter has not yet returned, but<lb/>will be here to-morrow evening. All his staff whom I have<lb/>seen are pleasant fellows and are quite kind to me. The<lb/>Assistant Adjutant-General, Captain Locke from New<lb/>York, is a very polite, gentlemanly fellow, and is a smart<lb/>business man. Lieutenant Batchelder is quite pleasant,<lb/>and Lieutenant McQuade seems to be the same, although<lb/>I have not seen much of him.</p><p>My tent was pitched this afternoon in the midst of a<lb/>driving snow-storm, and I shall not occupy it till I receive<lb/>some boards to make a floor, and a stove, both of which<lb/>I must beg in Washington. It will be quite a comfortable<lb/>tent when I shall have fixed it up a little. I have not dis-<lb/>covered any superfluous article yet which I have brought<lb/>out here, I am only sorry I did not buy me a bedstead<lb/>and cork mattress, which I shall have to get.

The day<lb/>was a beautiful one, and reminded one of spring. Towards<lb/>evening, however, it began to grow cold and chilly. A<lb/>large force under General [George W.] Morell made a<lb/>reconnoissance beyond Vienna, and as far as Hunter's<lb/>Mill. No enemy was seen except a few pickets. It was<lb/>made because intelligence was brought that a regiment<lb/>of cavalry had been seen around there for a day or two.</p><p>Saturday, February 15. Ã¢ÂÂ Snowy to-day.

The order was obeyed,<lb/>and such cheers I never heard before. The men were<lb/>delighted, and received in honor of the event a ration of<lb/>whiskey. General Porter was extremely pleased, and had<lb/>several colonels in his tent, to whom he gave whiskey,<lb/>etc. I unfortunately could not drink, but I made up for<lb/>it in wishing. We also heard that Savannah had been<lb/>taken, but whether this was true or not, I am unable to<lb/>say.

He also said that McClellan<lb/>meant that Burnside, Buell, and Halleck should all strike<lb/>at once, and that the delay to Burnside's expedition was<lb/>providential, as Buell was delayed by the state of the<lb/>roads, and Halleck by various matters. But the delay of<lb/>Burnside caused them all to act together, though of<lb/>course there was no communication held between these<lb/>different commanders, and their acting in concert was<lb/>in the end purely accidental.

He also thinks that the rebels<lb/>will not give up until they are whipped at Manassas, so<lb/>you see, I am glad to say, that we stand a fair chance of<lb/>having a battle before the war is over.

When he<lb/>did come I was introduced to him by Captain Locke, and<lb/>was warmly welcomed by him. I gave him your letter,<lb/>which he read. He asked how you were, and has since told<lb/>me that he had been meaning to send you a photograph<lb/>of his. He also wished me to remember him to you. He<lb/>advised me to drill with my regiment whenever it was<lb/>practicable, and to go out with General Martindale on his<lb/>brigade drills. My regiment have had no battalion drills<lb/>since I have been out here, on account of the mud. They<lb/>have had bayonet drills under sergeants, and target<lb/>practice, at neither of which I could attend as an officer.<lb/>I have been over there some five or six times, and when<lb/>I go, always stop and see my captain and lieutenant and<lb/>some other officers. My captain's name is Thomas, a<lb/>regular Yankee, with the nasal twang, sharp and smart,<lb/>and a very pleasant man, although not remarkably well<lb/>educated.

He raced round the field through bogs and ditches,<lb/>and brambles, etc., kicking and rearing, etc., but all to no<lb/>purpose. I clung on and ran him round until he got tired<lb/>of the business. To-day I went to Washington with the<lb/>general, and rode him (horse, not general) very fast<lb/>all the way. When I got in there we went to General<lb/>McClellan's headquarters and I left him out in the rain<lb/>and mud for three or four hours, not knowing the general<lb/>would stay so long, or else I should have put him in a<lb/>stable. I then galloped him almost all the way out here<lb/>through mud-holes and mud-ponds, etc., and on arriv-<lb/>ing here found that he was not tired or blowing at all.<lb/>I think it is a pretty good test for him.</p><p>Look out for news soon.

It stands back from the road<lb/>some 300 feet, and has a straight avenue leading to it,<lb/>with medium-sized trees planted on each side. Still it has<lb/>the true Southern look about it, viz., the air of neglect,<lb/>of something wanting to complete the estate, as if the<lb/>owner had begun with the idea of making a fine place and<lb/>had been stopped short for want of funds. The fences<lb/>round the place are of the most common kind, such as we<lb/>see in our pastures. What adds to the air of shiftlessness<lb/>is a sow with a litter of a dozen pigs rooting around the<lb/>trees and in what used to be a garden. She threatened to<lb/>bite me to-day when I went too near her young ones, and<lb/>worked upon my fears so much that I put my hand on<lb/>my pistol to shoot her, but she fortunately retreated. She<lb/>was a fierce and ugly creature. I offered James a quarter<lb/>to catch me one of the young ones, as I wanted to see<lb/>the sow run at him, but he thought it was safer to let<lb/>them alone. I tried to get General Porter to let me have<lb/>one killed for dinner, but he would not. You can tell<lb/>when you arrive in a Southern city by seeing pigs and<lb/>cattle running round in the streets. I have found it so in<lb/>Washington and Georgetown.</p><p>I got about three hours' sleep last night, being occupied<lb/>in packing, and writing for the general most of the time.<lb/>We had breakfast at 5 and started about 8 o'clock on our<lb/>advance. We reached here about 12, having a pouring<lb/>rain most of the way, from which I was well protected<lb/>by my rubber coat, and cap-cover which you bought me,</p><p/>

He has great powers of endurance, and was not<lb/>in the slightest degree tired when we reached here, al-<lb/>though I carried more on his back than any of the other<lb/>officers. I begin to think that it was a good plan having<lb/>him shaved. A few minutes after the rain was over he<lb/>was as dry as when he started, while the other horses<lb/>were wet and steaming. Nothing of any importance hap-<lb/>pened on the way, no rebels being seen, as they evacuated<lb/>the place yesterday. Colonel Averell we found here on<lb/>our arrival, he having started early in the morning. He<lb/>left soon after with McDowell's division for Centreville,<lb/>which place he has reached without finding any enemy,<lb/>and he is now pushing on to Manassas, which he will reach<lb/>to-night. The enemy have evacuated that place too, and<lb/>where they have gone no one knows.

They don't amount to anything and<lb/>were probably occupied by the rebel pickets some time<lb/>ago. On entering the town we struck the turnpike, which<lb/>is quite a decent road, and which forms the principal<lb/>street of the town. The Court House is situated on it<lb/>and is an old-fashioned brick building with a portico in<lb/>front. We should call this a small village in Massachu-<lb/>setts, but here it is quite a city in the estimation of the<lb/>F. F.

It was amusing to hear him "get<lb/>off" the usual stereotyped phrases about the enthusiasm,<lb/>alacrity, etc., of the soldiers, and then hear him say "big<lb/>lie," etc., to each phrase. For instance, when he wrote<lb/>about there being very few stragglers, I said I did n't<lb/>agree with him as I thought there were a good many.<lb/>"Oh, I know it," said he, "still I must write it so." That<lb/>is just the way these newspaper reporters do. All the<lb/>stories about fine drill, discipline, etc., we know to be un-<lb/>true half of the time. Still, on this morning's march the<lb/>soldiers did very well, as the roads were muddy and the<lb/>travelling very heavy.</p><p>The troops are all bivouacked to-night and some regi-<lb/>ments have what are called shelter tents, Ã¢ÂÂ small low<lb/>tents, accommodating three men, and equally distrib-<lb/>uted among the three men on a march, each one carrying<lb/>his share.</p><p>I am so sleepy that I must end and ask you to excuse<lb/>any deficiencies in the letter on account of my being so<lb/>tired.</p><p/>

It was<lb/>about half an hour from sundown, the air soft and balmy<lb/>as could be, and resembling some of our delightful autumn<lb/>or spring days. It was just the hour when the camps are<lb/>busiest, and present their most lively appearance. First<lb/>we came to a cavalry regiment with their horses fastened<lb/>to a long rope stretched along parallel with the road, and<lb/>eating their supper, neighing, biting and snapping at<lb/>each other. On my right was an undulating space cleared<lb/>of all trees and with some slight breastworks put up by<lb/>the enemy. This large plain was covered with camps full<lb/>of life and activity, soldiers marching to a review by<lb/>McClellan, with bands playing and their colors flying,<lb/>and a hum arising from those not yet in ranks. All this<lb/>was delightful to me, but to one who is accustomed to it<lb/>it loses its beauty in a great degree. Following this road<lb/>till I came to the turnpike, I turned to the right, and came<lb/>on a scene which I thought must resemble some European<lb/>city. Here were all these old-fashioned houses, with<lb/>queer windows and porches, guards before many of the<lb/>doors, and soldiers in many cases sitting in the porches<lb/>talking with the women of the house. The street was full<lb/>of soldiers in every imaginable attitude, and in perform-<lb/>ance of all sorts of duty.

Then<lb/>again all the soldiers would be talking in groups, which<lb/>seemed quite picturesque from the. variety of uniforms.<lb/>Sutlers' wagons, ambulances, baggage trains and a large<lb/>corral of cattle also appeared. I never was so well pleased<lb/>with any such sight and would have given a great deal if<lb/>I had been able to sketch it.</p><p>What I wrote you about McClellan the other day was<lb/>this. A cabinet meeting was held, so I heard, and an angry<lb/>discussion took place, most of them at first being in favor<lb/>of turning McClellan out altogether and putting McDow--<lb/>ell in his place (in the Army of the Potomac), but on<lb/>second thoughts they determined to confine McClellan's<lb/>command to the Army of the Potomac. The President<lb/>then told McClellan that he would be turned out if he<lb/>did not advance, and hence this advance was made.<lb/>This came from a source hostile to McClellan and I have<lb/>good reason to think is exaggerated. The President I<lb/>know ordered the advance, but I doubt if the whole of<lb/>the story is correct. McClellan's plan was, I think,<lb/>to go to Richmond by water, a much more practic-<lb/>able, less expensive and quicker method of doing the<lb/>business. It may be done so yet as there is no enemy to<lb/>fight here, and to advance on Richmond with our large<lb/>army will be an immense and tedious operation as all<lb/>the bridges are destroyed and we shall have to wait for<lb/>them to be rebuilt as we must depend on the railroad<lb/>for all such things.</p><p>I heard a curious story from Stedman, the World corre-<lb/>spondent, to-day.

The battle of Fair Oaks, in which our corps<lb/>did not take part, was fought on the other side of the<lb/>Chickahominy. We took turns in running the mess. The<lb/>week it was my turn I went out with the headquarters<lb/>wagon, with a negro driver and four horses, went to Old<lb/>Church, left the main road there, and took a circuit which<lb/>struck the main road again two or three miles farther on.<lb/>On this circuit I went to various farmhouses and bought<lb/>butter and eggs and chickens. With my wagon loaded<lb/>with supplies, as I was driving towards the main road, on<lb/>a curve, I saw an enormous amount of dust on the main<lb/>road into which my road ran. I stopped the driver and<lb/>told him to wait. I listened, then jumped out and crept<lb/>along the wall by the side of the road and peeked through<lb/>the crevices of the wall. To my horror, close to me I saw<lb/>an immense body of rebel cavalry going full tilt towards<lb/>our army. I crept back to the wagon, turned around and<lb/>drove back, meaning to enter the main road ahead of the<lb/>Confederates, as I hoped, and from there get back to<lb/>camp. About half a mile ahead of where the road ran into<lb/>the main road, I saw a battle going on, tents burning, and<lb/>pretty lively times. I drove into the wood and fastened<lb/>my horses to the trees and waited.</p><p>At night things quieted down and I started across coun-<lb/>try, and with the negro driver tramped until daylight,<lb/>when I ran into one of our pickets.

The men I saw were<lb/>General Stuart's^ Confederate cavalry, making the cele-<lb/>brated raid around our army. This was the second time<lb/>I had met my classmate Winsor. Once before, when I was<lb/>out foraging, I was driving up to a substantial looking<lb/>house where I afterwards found a Mrs. Brockenborough<lb/>lived. A company of our cavalry was riding out of the<lb/>avenue with a sheep at the head of every horse, and a<lb/>bundle of corn-shucks behind each rider, turkeys and<lb/>chickens, pigs and everything else, hanging from the<lb/>saddles. Harry Winsor was commanding the squadron.<lb/>He told me I would not find much left in the house, he<lb/>thought. I went up to the house and there was Mrs.<lb/>Brockenborough, and a madder lady I never saw in my<lb/>life. I tried to buy some supplies, but she said nothing<lb/>had been left her.</p><p>I remember going with a message to General McClel-<lb/>lan, while before Yorktown, and asking him to give me<lb/>his autograph on one of his photographs, which he very<lb/>kindly did. He was a charming man, and after knowing<lb/>him, one could well understand why our troops had such<lb/>immense confidence in him. Indeed I think he inspired<lb/>more confidence than any general that ever came after<lb/>him, although many who succeeded him undoubtedly<lb/>had more push and go in them than he had.</p><p>One of the most interesting things that happened while<lb/>we were besieging Yorktown was an experience of General<lb/>Porter's. He got up early one morning, at about half-<lb/>past five or six, and went up in a balloon which was used<lb/>by the army and was under the charge, I believe, of the<lb/>aeronaut, Mr. Low.

I was not yet dressed when my orderly ran in<lb/>and said, "General Porter's balloon has broken loose and<lb/>he is sailing over us." I rushed out, and there, about a<lb/>mile up in the sky, saw the balloon, with of course, as we<lb/>all knew, General Porter in it. It sailed away over our<lb/>heads, then off toward the enemies' tents as one current<lb/>took it, then, as it entered another current, came back<lb/>over our camp, where it rapidly descended. As General<lb/>Porter afterwards told me, when he found the balloon<lb/>had broken loose, he looked around for the ropes to pull<lb/>the valve to let out the gas. He found to his dismay that<lb/>they were tied six or eight feet up in the netting, away<lb/>from the car. So all he could do was to climb up, while a<lb/>mile up in the air, into this netting, get hold of the ropes,<lb/>climb down into the car again, and then, when a current<lb/>of wind took him over our camp, open the valves and<lb/>pull on the ropes. This he did with all his vigor, and he<lb/>came down, landing on a shelter tent, without being<lb/>hurt or hurting any one else. He was a little overcome<lb/>by the fumes of the gas, but that was all.</p><p>I remember how gingerly we went into Yorktown the<lb/>morning of the evacuation. There were several mines<lb/>laid there, some of which exploded by contact. I was in<lb/>momentary expectation of being blown up, but luckily no<lb/>such bad luck befell me.</p><p>Soon after the battle of Hanover Court House the army<lb/>was in camp before Richmond, with half the force on one<lb/>side of the Chickahominy and half on the other.

On the second day of the fight, at Gaines's<lb/>Mill, General Porter sent me out with eight or ten cavalry-<lb/>men to find General Meade, who was then in charge of<lb/>the Pennsylvania Bucktails, and to ask him to report as<lb/>soon as possible with his command. On the way out I<lb/>came to the old camp at Gaines's Mill, where we had been<lb/>for some time and which he had just left that morning.</p><p>As I was crossing the bridge at the mill, I met Lieuten-<lb/>ant Hayden,^ commanding a company of artillery in<lb/>the regular service, who asked me where I was going.<lb/>I told him I was going to try to find General Meade, and<lb/>he said, " You won't find him on that road; all our forces<lb/>are withdrawn."</p><p>"Well," I said, " I was told to come out here and find<lb/>him, and I am going to try to do it."</p><p>I got out to the road leading to Gaines's house, just<lb/>where our tents had been, and in a wood just about<lb/>a couple of hundred yards away, I heard heavy firing.<lb/>I posted my escort along the apple trees in the avenue,<lb/>and went ahead to reconnoitre myself, a foolish and un-<lb/>necessary proceeding. I got to the edge of the woods, and<lb/>found them so thick that I had to dismount and fasten my<lb/>horse. I came out of the thicket where I tied him, and<lb/>twenty yards in front of me was a line of rebel skirmishers.<lb/>I had on a cap without any U.

I had gone only a few feet before one of the of-<lb/>ficers stopped me, saying, "Hold on, I think you had bet-<lb/>ter come and see our major."</p><p>I went up to him and said, " It is no use, I am a Union<lb/>officer."</p><p>He then took me along with him on the skirmishing<lb/>line, until Hayden began shelling us; soon a shell burst<lb/>right over our heads.

Without going into this controversy<lb/>too much in detail, as the matter has already been settled<lb/>by much more competent military authorities than I am,<lb/>I will merely say here that throughout the whole of this<lb/>campaign I never saw Porter more vigilant, or more de-<lb/>termined to do his duty, or trying harder to bring success<lb/>to our armies, than during this period. Lieutenant Mon-<lb/>teith and I were the only aides he had, and therefore<lb/>had unusual opportunities of seeing what was going on,<lb/>and of knowing his feelings and what he was trying to do.<lb/>As I have said, all this was amply confirmed by the second<lb/>court, which convened some years afterwards, several of<lb/>us having meanwhile made unceasing efforts to that end,<lb/>and which I shall refer to later on.</p><p>On the morning of August 30 we marched, by Pope's<lb/>orders, from the vicinity of Manassas Junction, to join<lb/>his army at Bull Run.

He (Pope) said that he did not know where<lb/>his own men were, or where Jackson was. General Porter<lb/>later sent him one of our own men, who had been made<lb/>a prisoner by the Confederates and escaped, who said<lb/>the enemy were in full retreat. General Porter said he<lb/>did not believe the man's story, but thought he ought to<lb/>send him to Pope with all the information he had. General<lb/>Pope sent back word that he believed the man's story,<lb/>and that we were to attack at once and press the enemy<lb/>with vigor, Ã¢ÂÂ which is a matter of history.</p><p>We went into the woods where Sigel had been the day<lb/>before disastrously defeated, going over the ground<lb/>covered with dead bodies, and attempted to attack the<lb/>enemy in a cut which had been excavated for a railroad<lb/>which was to have been built but never had been finished.<lb/>Here we met with a repulse, and on retreating we were<lb/>attacked on our flank by Longstreet. He had followed us<lb/>from the extreme left, taking the very course we had<lb/>taken that morning. Where the road that we came on and<lb/>that Longstreet came on joined the Centreville Pike,<lb/>the fight was very hot towards dusk. General McDowell<lb/>rode up to General Porter and said, "Porter, you ought<lb/>to put in the Regulars here." Ã¢ÂÂ "I will do so," said Por-<lb/>ter, "if you order me to." Ã¢ÂÂ "No," said McDowell,<lb/>" I will not take the responsibility." Porter then said he<lb/>would do it anyway. He put in the Regulars and checked<lb/>Longstreet's advance. He was within two or three hun-<lb/>dred yards of the Pike, and if he had gained that, it would<lb/>have meant a disastrous rout for our whole army.^</p><p>1 In the midst of the battle I was riding across an open field, with a few</p><p/>

To-night I was struck by one in particular. We<lb/>have a large fire kept burning outside our tents all the<lb/>time, around which we all of us frequently gather. To-<lb/>night about 7 o'clock we were all around the fire in<lb/>various attitudes, some sitting, others standing, etc.,<lb/>generals, colonels, etc., in fact all grades down to privates<lb/>were represented. A guard brought in two negroes from<lb/>Yorktown, they having made their way up to our lines.<lb/>As soon as they had been questioned by the general, some<lb/>one gave them some crackers, and down they dumped<lb/>themselves on a pile of wood close by the blazing fire.

I wrote Hannah a day<lb/>or two ago that we were all going to advance. It turned<lb/>out that it was to be a reconnoissance only. They saw a<lb/>few of the enemy and killed one. We advanced beyond<lb/>Big Bethel to within 6 miles of Yorktown. I had to stay<lb/>here in camp to see that things went straight. I did not<lb/>lose much, however. The rebels had been working on the<lb/>fortifications at B. Bethel the very morning our troops<lb/>advanced, but when they reached there, the rebels had<lb/>run ofif with their cannon. They had captured two of our<lb/>men, outside of our picket lines, where they were ex-<lb/>pressly forbidden to go, in the morning, and so had no-<lb/>tice of our advance. Our pickets have orders to shoot<lb/>any man they see outside the lines, whether on our side<lb/>or not.

To-day we have<lb/>had both kinds, our artillery in Hamilton's division having<lb/>fired continually from early this morning, and being as<lb/>warmly replied to by the rebels. From a dead or leafless<lb/>tree behind the general's tent, a ladder some 75 feet in<lb/>length has been built, and this we use as a look-out. From<lb/>this ladder I saw our gunboats and the rebels' batteries<lb/>fire at each other, but without any injury to either side.<lb/>Our fuses were all too short, the shell bursting in the air<lb/>a mile ofT from the rebel battery. They fired from a large<lb/>105-pound pivot gun, and fired very well, too.

There<lb/>are frequently twenty guns fired in a minute, the reports<lb/>of which we can hear quite plainly as we are only about<lb/>a mile and a half from them.</p><p>I had a fine view of Yorktown and Gloucester Point</p><p>yesterday. I crossed over a bridge over Creek,</p><p>which bridge we have just built, and then went out to a<lb/>point which projects into the river. I was about three<lb/>quarters of a mile from Yorktown, and could see the<lb/>rebels at work very plainly ; they have two strong water<lb/>batteries, and above these still stronger ones. The banks<lb/>are very steep and precipitous here, and afford a fine op-<lb/>portunity to place works. At Gloucester Point on the op-<lb/>posite side, they also have strong batteries, and we could<lb/>see their men all run when they saw the smoke from one<lb/>of our gunboats.

It does not come<lb/>from our whole line at once, but is kept up on any of<lb/>their working parties we see, and by them upon our gun-<lb/>boats and barges. It seems strange to hear the reports<lb/>of heavy guns, and the whistling of shot all the time, but<lb/>one soon gets used to it. At times, as last night, the firing<lb/>becomes pretty rapid, and then we are all routed out, to go<lb/>to bed again in a few minutes. The enemy made an attack<lb/>last night upon our pickets, but withdrew as quickly as<lb/>they came out, but making us all leave our beds to repel<lb/>them. The place is a perfect Paradise for fleas and wood-<lb/>ticks. They abound in every place, and are the bane of<lb/>one's existence.

I can't imagine why they left it<lb/>whole, unless it was that we came upon them unawares.<lb/>Indeed, one of their men said that they did not expect<lb/>us for a week, and when we advanced thought that<lb/>we only meant to make a reconnoissance, as we did<lb/>once before when we advanced to Big Bethel from<lb/>Hampton.</p><p>I have to take messages to the different brigade or<lb/>regimental commanders when an attack is anticipated or<lb/>when the message is too important to be trusted to an<lb/>orderly.

Whenever you get<lb/>an opportunity to send me any books, they will be very<lb/>welcome. I go to bed by nine o'clock, and always get a<lb/>good night's sleep. Whenever the fight begins, there will<lb/>be plenty of work to be done, and no time to read. My<lb/>opinion is that we shall not open fire on them until they<lb/>open on us. We shall dig our trenches, and make the<lb/>parallels until we are troubled by them, and then our<lb/>batteries will open on them. The nearer we get to them<lb/>the better it is for us, and so it would be folly to provoke<lb/>their fire by opening on them, when by keeping still our<lb/>men can get nearer to their works. I think our men began<lb/>to work on the trenches last night. The whole affair will<lb/>be conducted on scientific principles applied by skilful<lb/>engineers, and with a man at the head whose forte is in<lb/>this kind of warfare, namely General McClellan. My<lb/>idea is that he will take the place with the least possible<lb/>sacrifice of life, and in order to do this, he must have<lb/>sufficient time to carry out all his plans thoroughly, and<lb/>employ the men in trenches, etc., until we get within a<lb/>reasonable distance to storm their works, if such a course<lb/>be necessary to drive them out. The enemy have made a<lb/>fatal mistake in not cutting down the woods to a greater<lb/>distance from their works. They have just left a belt of<lb/>woods, which forms a splendid line for us to build bat-<lb/>teries and form a base for our operations, and which also<lb/>affords a shelter to our encampments. The last few days<lb/>have been unusually quiet, very few skirmishes taking<lb/>place. We have one battery on our extreme right, on a<lb/>promontory in the York River, close to a Colonel Flarin-<lb/>lecoult's house, which mounts 6 guns, 5 lOO-pounder<lb/>Parrott guns, and one 200-pound gun.

As it is, every man is considered of great account,<lb/>and as the battle will come off at Williamsburg, McClellan<lb/>cannot spare the loss of so many men, which would neces-<lb/>sarily ensue from storming the works here, and so weaken<lb/>his force before the time came for the attack at Williams-<lb/>burg. Yorktown once in our possession, the York River<lb/>is ours, and with it, more suitable landing-places for<lb/>goods, etc. Even should the enemy leave Yorktown<lb/>without a battle, which I think is barely possible, the<lb/>gain will be on our side, notwithstanding the immense<lb/>time and labor spent on our works. You see how much<lb/>harm has been done by some one, in detaching McDowell.<lb/>It has caused a delay of some weeks, and all for the pur-<lb/>pose of injuring McClellan by McDowell's gain.

It is called a provisional corps, I imagine,<lb/>because it is of McClellan's making, and is not firmly<lb/>established. It will, however, be a permanent thing,<lb/>I suppose.

The White House farm belongs to a<lb/>man named " Rooney " Lee,^ who was in '58, and was in<lb/>College with me about two years. He left some six months<lb/>before his class graduated, to enter the army, and at the<lb/>breaking out of the Rebellion he left our army and joined<lb/>the rebels.

Captain Locke and some others of our stafif<lb/>went ofif to ride on one of the numerous side roads which<lb/>abound in this country, the other day, and in the course<lb/>of their ride stopped at a house by the way. Here they<lb/>found a crazy man, the son of the man who owned the<lb/>place, who was confined in a small out-house or den separ-<lb/>ate from the house. Here he was chained naked, and with<lb/>no furniture but a small quantity of straw to lie on. His<lb/>food was conveyed to him on the end of a stick which was<lb/>thrust through the window. Just imagine a human being<lb/>chained like a wild beast in a cage, and this in the middle<lb/>of the nineteenth century. They said his howls and<lb/>shrieks were terrible, and made them shudder to hear<lb/>them. A fair sample of most of the poor whites and<lb/>farmers. Ignorant, and as superstitious as the people of a<lb/>hundred years ago. No idea in their head, but that of<lb/>secession, and this slowly dawning on them as a humbug,<lb/>and meaning ruin to them and advancement to the rich.</p><p>I am glad to hear you say that you have confidence in<lb/>McClellan. You may think him slow, but remember, he is<lb/>sure. He is hampered by Stanton, whose orders and com-<lb/>mands have delayed, worried and retarded McClellan,<lb/>and lengthened this war.

I was in as much danger of getting shot by our<lb/>own pickets as by theirs, for they are not apt to challenge<lb/>when they know the enemy are near. I saw them first, and<lb/>called to them, and found out the way to camp. At three<lb/>o'clock, after tramping along through forests and woods,<lb/>and mud knee deep, I came to a church where I met a<lb/>Lieutenant Winsor, who was in my class for a year. He<lb/>very kindly lent me a horse which I rode home to camp.<lb/>I never was more grateful for any favor than I was for<lb/>the loan of this horse, for I was worn out mentally from<lb/>constant watchfulness for the enemy and for pickets,<lb/>and the cords of my legs were sore enough from tugging</p><p/>

The officers told us to<lb/>lie down in the trench, whenever we saw a gun fired, and<lb/>kept a man on the watch, who called out "fire" when he<lb/>saw a gun go off, and down we would all go. They fired<lb/>splendidly at us, planting the shell in the battery and all<lb/>around it. My horse was tied to a tree behind the bat-<lb/>tery, and I thought his chance of escaping was pretty<lb/>small. I had to stay till the 12 shots were fired, to tell<lb/>the general the result, and was glad when they were all<lb/>fired. Our firing was indifferent. I waited till the enemy<lb/>had fired two shots in succession, and then made a rush<lb/>for my horse with a lieutenant from Weeden's Battery<lb/>whom I met there. It did not take us long to get out of<lb/>range. The enemy were 1000 yards distant.</p><p>I had a narrower escape the other day than I thought<lb/>for.

In the face of all these facts, and not-<lb/>withstanding McClellan's frequent and earnest appeals<lb/>for more troops, the Government at Washington refuses<lb/>us any reinforcements. The Abolitionists in Congress<lb/>have a great deal to do with this, and are purposely pro-<lb/>tracting the war in order to render emancipation necessary,<lb/>and are so endangering our existence as a nation united<lb/>and whole.

General Pope, in my opinion, is a complete</p><p>failure. He can handle 10,000 men, but no more. We</p><p>still have communication with Washington via Aquia</p><p>Creek. I hope we shall see a successful issue to this</p><p>trouble.</p><p>Centreville, Aug. 31, 1862.</p><p>Dear Father, Ã¢ÂÂ We had a severe battle at Bull Run<lb/>yesterday, and were obliged to retire to this place. The<lb/>retreat was conducted in good order, and without the loss<lb/>of wagons, etc. General Porter's corps did most of the<lb/>fighting. Pope made a complete muddle of the whole af-<lb/>fair and ordered us into a place where we were hit hard.<lb/>I can only thank God that I got out safe. We were under<lb/>a very severe fire of musketry, round shot, shell and case-<lb/>shot. My horse was slightly wounded in the leg by a<lb/>musket shot. If we ever reach Washington in safety, it<lb/>will be more than I expect.</p><p>Pope has blundered terribly. He let Jackson get be-<lb/>tween him and Washington, destroy any number of cars<lb/>and the railroad track at Manassas Junction and the<lb/>telegraph. Jackson then went to Centreville, then to<lb/>Bull Run. Ewell^ is killed on the rebel side. Lee com-<lb/>manded the rebel centre where we attacked. Pope knows<lb/>he is dead if he retreats to Washington and so he keeps<lb/>us here, where the enemy may cut off our supplies. The<lb/>place itself is very strong and we occupy the enemy's old<lb/>works. . . .</p><p>[The beginning of the next letter is lost, but I remember<lb/>the circumstances which occasioned it. Colonel Webb,</p><p>' This was a mistake. Ewell lost a leg on August 28, but was not killed.</p><p/>

He thought<lb/>from Pope's manner that he was displeased at Ruggles<lb/>asking him to breakfast, and so he took up his hat and<lb/>bid them good morning.

Pope will probably try<lb/>to blame Porter, and lay the blame of the whole matter<lb/>on him, on the ground of disobedience of orders.

When the 4th Michigan crossed the<lb/>river the other evening, he said, they drove a whole bri-<lb/>gade of rebels, who ran shamefully. These are Colonel<lb/>Lee's own words. He also said that the rebels deserted<lb/>27 guns that evening, of which we got four, not knowing<lb/>where the rest were. There is no doubt that the rebels are<lb/>mighty hard up for food and clothing. There were some<lb/>forty of our dead there, and all of them had their shoes<lb/>taken and pockets rifled. The faces of the dead were hor-<lb/>rible. Some could hardly be distinguished from negroes,<lb/>their faces were so black. I had charge of burying a good<lb/>many of them.

On the<lb/>left of Sharpsburg the ridge is mostly free from woods.<lb/>All that we could see of Sharpsburg was two steeples, the<lb/>rest of the town being hidden in the valley beyond the<lb/>ridge. All along this ridge the rebels had batteries placed,<lb/>both on the right and left of the road. Their infantry,<lb/>according to their custom, was hidden in the woods. Our<lb/>batteries were, except on the extreme right, placed on a<lb/>line of hills parallel to the Antietam, and on the south of<lb/>it. Our infantry held about the line I have marked in ink.<lb/>The attack began early in the morning, the artillery on<lb/>both sides firing rapidly at each other.

In regard to the<lb/>political course of the Administration, General P. says,<lb/>and very sensibly, that the South is under the control<lb/>of the most wicked men in the world. Now, our great<lb/>object should be to make the people feel this and dis-<lb/>gust them with their rulers. But all this abolition talk is<lb/>a great handle for Jeff.

He certainly seems to me to be right.<lb/>In regard to slavery, I think General P. is right. Leave<lb/>the whole thing alone, and as our armies advance, slav-<lb/>ery must go under.</p><p>In the present campaign I think we are going to push<lb/>for Front Royal, thus compelling the enemy to retreat<lb/>from Winchester and the Valley, from fear of being cut<lb/>off, and if possible to push them so that they will have to<lb/>give fight.</p><p/>

The ultras, with Sumner and Co., are trying to<lb/>break up the present Cabinet, and make it very ultra<lb/>indeed, saying, a la Tribune, that the President should rely<lb/>more on the party who put him in power. Their plan is<lb/>to put Fremont in as general-in-chief, and of this several<lb/>conservative Republican members of Congress are very<lb/>much afraid. Should it be done, our ruin will be complete<lb/>and effectual. Since the recent reverse, I don't think the<lb/>army will stand any more trifling. Such an act would<lb/>cause innumerable resignations among our best and high-<lb/>est officers, or might even lead to direct acts of violence<lb/>against the Government, from the army. In such a case,<lb/>I should not at all be surprised to see Lincoln kicked out,<lb/>and a dictator put in command. . . . May heaven save<lb/>us from any such steps, for we shall surely be lost if such<lb/>things become necessary, or rather seem necessary, to any<lb/>one. The triumph of the ultra Republicans would be the<lb/>triumph of the rebels, and the ruin of this nation.</p><p>Then there is a second party, composed of conserv-<lb/>ative men of all parties, but chiefly Republicans, with<lb/>Seward at the head. The story to-day is that Seward is to<lb/>remain in the Cabinet, and all the rest of the Cabinet<lb/>except Welles to be turned off, and Halleck with them.<lb/>Then Seward is to have the formation of the new Cab-<lb/>inet. I hope this latter story is true. I hear, however,<lb/>that Fremont is staying at the White House, which<lb/>makes the first supposition look unpleasantly probable.</p><p>Anyhow, things are in a perfect turmoil here, and<lb/>everything is upside down. The Cabinet is about broken<lb/>up, Chase among others having handed in his resignation,<lb/>much to my joy. I only hope the President will choose<lb/>wisely and well, and save us from ruin.

			<p>STEPHEN M. WELD 167</p><p>April I, Ã¢ÂÂ General Benham and Lieutenant Perkins<lb/>went to Washington. The army was stampeded last<lb/>night by a report that the enemy were coming down on<lb/>us. From all that I can learn, it was probably an "April<lb/>Fool." I went down to Dalton's to-day, and then to<lb/>General Griffin's. Also saw Colonel Hayes in regard to<lb/>George, and received a favorable answer. W^ent to the<lb/>22d Massachusetts with Barnard, and saw Sherwin.<lb/>Day pleasant and windy. I should judge from indications<lb/>I see around me, that the next move will be in the direc-<lb/>tion of Burnside's mud movement.^ Some think that we<lb/>shall be sent out to the Mississippi. Granting furloughs<lb/>again certainly does not look much like a speedy move.</p><p>April 2. Ã¢ÂÂ Channing Clapp came over from camp, and<lb/>we went over to General Sedgwick's together. As we<lb/>found no one in there, we went to General Devens's,-<lb/>where we saw the general, Colonel Eustis, and Lieuten-<lb/>ant Davis of the 1st Massachusetts Cavalry. I sent the<lb/>general's letter asking for Clapp, to General Williams,<lb/>and also a communication asking to have him detailed<lb/>as acting assistant adjutant-general until his regular<lb/>appointment arrived. Saw General W. personally about<lb/>it. Weather pleasant, but very windy in the evening.</p><p>April 3. Ã¢ÂÂ General Benham arrived here this morning<lb/>at 8 o'clock. About 11 a.m. Lieutenant Van Brocklin,<lb/>Captain Strang, and I started for Major Spaulding's old<lb/>camp. From there we went to the new camp, and then<lb/>to the picket line, but here we were stopped, our passes<lb/>being of no avail. On the way back, stopped at the 20th<lb/>Massachusetts and saw Major George N. Macy. Camp<lb/>was partially surrounded with a hedge to-day.</p><p>1 This refers to the Fredericksburg campaign, which was so called.<lb/>^ General Charles Devens, afterwards Justice of the Massachusetts Su-<lb/>preme Court, and Attorney-General of the U.

He could not get my money, so that I shall<lb/>be obliged to go to Washington for it myself. The day<lb/>has been cold and disagreeable, and promised a storm,<lb/>which began about nightfall.

They are<lb/>granting furloughs again, on the ground that the roads<lb/>are bad. These high winds that we are having, how-<lb/>ever, are drying the roads wonderfully fast. I went out<lb/>yesterday on the Warrenton road, about to be an impor-<lb/>tant one, I judge, and found it very bad. The mud move-<lb/>ment under Burnside cut it up so much that it will be<lb/>some time before it is decent again. I was going out<lb/>of the lines on business, but had so much trouble with<lb/>the pickets that it got too late to go. The President and<lb/>his wife are coming down this afternoon, to review the<lb/>troops. The review will come off to-morrow.</p><p>Channing Clapp of the 1st Massachusetts Cavalry will<lb/>probably be appointed as our adjutant-general.

About ten o'clock the sun came out, and<lb/>before night the snow had almost entirely disappeared.<lb/>I went over to the Sixth Corps with Dalton about one<lb/>o'clock. I saw Dr. Dalton there. Went from there with<lb/>Whittier to Brigadier General Devens. General Benham<lb/>called Lieutenant Roosa up to-day in regard to disturb-<lb/>ance while the general was in Washington. Also a sutler<lb/>named Jerry. There was to have been a grand review of<lb/>all the cavalry to-day, but it was postponed on account<lb/>of the weather. Major Cassin was here to-day. A detail<lb/>of 500 men was ordered this evening.</p><p>April 6. Ã¢ÂÂ I went over to General Sickles's headquar-<lb/>ters this morning with a letter from General Benham in<lb/>regard to the difficulty of passing our picket line. Gen-<lb/>eral S. sent his compliments to General Benham, and said<lb/>he would issue a general order on the subject. After leav-<lb/>ing there, I went over to the cavalry review of General<lb/>Stoneman's corps. It was a fine sight, and almost every<lb/>one who had a horse was present. As the President came<lb/>in sight he was saluted with the usual number of guns.<lb/>General Steinwehr, Major-General Sickles, Meade, Rey-<lb/>nolds, Hooker, and Slocum, and Brigadier Generals Pratt,<lb/>Kane, etc., were present. I saw Waldo Merriam, Scott, ^<lb/>Phillips, Martin,- Colonel Vincent, and numerous other<lb/>friends of mine there.

We had brigade<lb/>guard-mounting for the first time to-day, and I officiated<lb/>as assistant adjutant-general. A few days' experience<lb/>will make the whole thing go ofT quite successfully. In<lb/>the evening I went over to General Hooker's head-<lb/>quarters.</p><p>April 7. Ã¢ÂÂ We all started out this morning, except<lb/>Perkins, to see the review, by the President, of the army.<lb/>On arriving at headquarters, we found that the review<lb/>was postponed on account of the mud. Day pleasant.</p><p>April 8. Ã¢ÂÂ To-day there was a review of the Second,<lb/>Third, Fifth, and Sixth Corps by the President. It was<lb/>one of the finest spectacles I have ever seen. The differ-<lb/>ent corps arranged in line, with their flags of all colors,<lb/>contrasting well with the dark blue of the uniforms, was<lb/>a very pretty sight. As they passed in review they<lb/>would come to the shoulder, and then double-quick as<lb/>soon as past the President. I went over in the evening<lb/>to see Starr, ^ and had a very pleasant time. Received a<lb/>letter from Hannah full of interesting items. Mounted<lb/>guard this evening quite successfully, and I believe made<lb/>no mistake. This is the third time that we have had<lb/>brigade guard-mounting. Day very pleasant. Several<lb/>ladies were at the review, and among others Mrs. Lin-<lb/>coln. The President's son rode at the head of the review-<lb/>ing column. It was quite exciting when riding through<lb/>the lines, as we did, at a full gallop. There were several<lb/>ditches in the way which we had to leap, and in trying</p><p>^ Captain James Starr, of Rush's Lancers. They had a lance with a small<lb/>red flag on it. They were called "Turkey Gobblers" by the men, and when-<lb/>ever they passed the infantry every one began to gobble. It was extremely<lb/>annoying to them, particularly as they were a fine regiment, under perfect<lb/>discipline, and always performed most eff^ective service.</p><p/>

On our way we came<lb/>to the camp of the i6th Massachusetts and stopped and<lb/>saw Captain Amory. We then continued on our way over<lb/>the corduroy road until we came to the camp of the 1st<lb/>New York Volunteers. Both sides of the corduroy road<lb/>were lined by Sickles's corps, who were out to cheer<lb/>Father Abraham. We found John in, and spent a very<lb/>pleasant hour with him. From there we went to Belle<lb/>Plain, to see about the pontoon boats. I found Major<lb/>Cassin there, and Captain Wood. Saw the canvas boats,<lb/>and reported their condition to the general. On my way<lb/>back I stopped at Rush's Lancers' camp, and saw Win-<lb/>sor, Furness, and Davis.</p><p>When I arrived here at camp, I found that the general<lb/>had gone out on a reconnoissance toward and beyond<lb/>White Oak Church, General Reynolds's headquarters.</p><p>* John C.

To-morrow,<lb/>I am glad to say, I shall be relieved from duty as adju-<lb/>tant-general by Channing Clapp. Although I have got<lb/>along very well with General Benham, I don't think I<lb/>should like to be his adjutant-general permanently. He<lb/>is not at all well posted in regard to office business, and<lb/>keeps doing things which are irregular, and the .blame of<lb/>which, if any mischief should ensue, would fall upon the<lb/>unfortunate adjutant-general. I have never got into any<lb/>scrape with him, except once, and I did it then from fol-<lb/>lowing out his orders. I gave a certificate of "muster<lb/>out" to an officer, in order that he might be mustered in,<lb/>with his new and increased rank. The general had given<lb/>me an express order to do so in all such cases, but as it<lb/>happened, he did not wish this officer to get his new rank<lb/>as it had been obtained in a rather underhand manner.<lb/>The officer, too, lied to me in regard to his commission,<lb/>and so obtained the certificate.

I did as he directed, however, as I did not wish<lb/>to have a quarrel with the general. Of course the proper<lb/>way for the general to have done would have been to<lb/>demand the certificate back on the ground that it was<lb/>fraudulently obtained. As it was, it exposed me to insult,<lb/>etc., by having my authority to sign a paper called into<lb/>question, and indeed, I don't see why any officer might<lb/>hot now refuse to obey any order signed by me, on the<lb/>ground that I had signed it without authority. Even<lb/>if I had signed it without authority, it was very impolitic<lb/>for the general to have a written statement made to that<lb/>effect, when he could get out of the scrape in any other<lb/>way. This, and one or two other things of a like nature<lb/>done to others on the staff, makes me feel rather anxious<lb/>in regard to the future. If anything the general orders<lb/>to be done is not successful, I very much fear that the<lb/>blame may be thrown on his staff officer, whoever he may<lb/>be, by the general disavowing the act or order. He has<lb/>constantly thrown the blame of all his former troubles<lb/>on other people. However, it will only make me more<lb/>careful and anxious to do my duty faithfully. I don't<lb/>wish you to think that I am on unpleasant terms with<lb/>General Benham or that I have had any serious trouble.<lb/>We are on the best of terms, and he did not blame me<lb/>much about the certificate, but, as you know, straws<lb/>show which way the wind blows, and I, of course, wish<lb/>to go through this war with honor, and don't want to<lb/>render myself liable to any blame. Now, this present<lb/>position in the Engineer Brigade is a very ticklish one.<lb/>Any amount of blame and censure has been heaped on<lb/>the former commander, and should it come on the present<lb/>one, I prefer that it should not be shoved off on my</p><p/>

Of course,<lb/>an aide's reputation, honor and everything is in the<lb/>hands of his general, and if an aide cannot feel that his<lb/>general will support the orders he gives him to carry or<lb/>to perform, why there is an end of him. Now, I think<lb/>I can easily get on some other staff, and after giving you,<lb/>in perfect confidence and with a knowledge that yoii will see<lb/>it in its true light and keep it perfectly secret, a full state-<lb/>ment of the case, I wish to know your opinion about it.<lb/>I know the general is satisfied with me and has perfect<lb/>confidence in me, and as a companion he is jolly and agree-<lb/>able. But then he is very incautious in what he says<lb/>about others, and censures the acts and abilities and do-<lb/>ings of other generals in a way which must get him into<lb/>trouble, and which has, undoubtedly, in my. opinion,<lb/>made him enemies in his former campaigns, and led him<lb/>into many of his scrapes. He is very ambitious, and very<lb/>conceited. Of course everything here is for your ear<lb/>alone, and must go no further.</p><p>We shall probably move in two or three days. The<lb/>roads are all dry, and all the preparations are being<lb/>made for a speedy move, probably down the river. By<lb/>the time you get this we shall be on our w^ay, unless<lb/>storms prevent.

At United States Ford,<lb/>the rise on the enemy's side is very much less. I do not<lb/>think that General Hooker liked either place as a cross-<lb/>ing for the army. Coming back, we saw a working party<lb/>leaving Bank's Ford. At United States Ford we saw<lb/>about half a regiment behind the rifle-pits. Some of them<lb/>called out to us, and asked us to come over. Our cavalry,<lb/>which moved last Monday (that is, yesterday), crossed<lb/>the river at Kelly's Ford. On my way back I stopped in<lb/>Falmouth and saw John Perry, who arrived this after-<lb/>noon.

The horses are very poor<lb/>indeed, and very green. The train is in charge of Mr.<lb/>Waterman, who receives $150 a month, and 16 mechan-<lb/>ics, who have from $2 to $2.50 [a day].

Here there are to be three bridges. One<lb/>mile below this point there are to be two bridges. On<lb/>these five bridges the main part of our army will cross, as<lb/>I think. Then there are two bridges to be thrown across<lb/>the river at Bank's Ford or near there, to cause a diver-<lb/>sion. This movement, together with that of our cavalry,<lb/>who crossed the river at Rappahannock Station yester-<lb/>day, will bring a large force of the enemy up the river.<lb/>Then a division marched down the river yesterday to<lb/>Port Royal, where some of them will cross to create a di-<lb/>version there. Of course I am not sure that such is the<lb/>plan, but so it seems to me. The weather, however, may<lb/>interfere seriously with us, as it has several times already.<lb/>It really seems as if everything went against us.</p><p>I get along very well with General Benham, and give<lb/>him no possible chance to catch me napping, or disre-<lb/>garding orders.

I tried to explain to him that<lb/>the colonel was acting in good faith and that he meant<lb/>nothing impertinent. He would not hear a word, how-<lb/>ever, and on seeing him tear the paper, I could not help<lb/>feeling disgusted, both at his folly and anger.

There is a feeling that the golden opportunity has<lb/>passed away, and that if we cross now we shall have Hill<lb/>and Longstreet's forces to contend with in addition to<lb/>Lee's force. Had we gone over last Monday, we should<lb/>not have half the force to contend against that we have<lb/>now. However, it does not do to give way to any such<lb/>feelings, especially before the men, and we must all do the<lb/>utmost in our power to help and aid General Hooker. In<lb/>regard to his drinking, I will say to you what I have never<lb/>spoken about to any one else outside the army, / know<lb/>of his having been tight twice since I have been here, al-<lb/>though I hope he does not indulge enough to render him<lb/>incompetent to perform his duty. He is, to tell the truth,<lb/>a brave, dashing soldier, rather an adventurer than any-<lb/>thing else, and bound to win or lose everything. Too<lb/>much given to boasting and talking, he is nevertheless a<lb/>man who will win the love and admiration of the soldiers,<lb/>provided that he succeeds in his first fight. Whether he<lb/>possesses the ability and the power to handle this large<lb/>army remains to be seen. So far, in my opinion, General<lb/>Butterfield has "run the machine," and he is admirably<lb/>fitted to attend to its internal discipline, etc. I feel anx-<lb/>ious myself in regard to General Hooker, on account of<lb/>the numerous delays we have had. They are certainly as<lb/>bad, if not worse, than any of McClellan's, and we must<lb/>certainly admit that either Hooker is right and McClel-<lb/>lan also, or that Hooker is wrong as much as McClellan<lb/>ever was.

Yet this afternoon I was told by an officer where<lb/>and for what purpose the officer was sent. It leaked out<lb/>from headquarters of the Army of the Potomac in some<lb/>way. It is a difficult thing to keep anything secret.</p><p>April 29, Ã¢ÂÂ At 6 the first bridge was begun, and at 7<lb/>it was completed. About 8.30 we all started for the lower<lb/>crossing, where we had been repulsed in our attempt at<lb/>crossing. At 9 o'clock our men, protected by rifle-pits,<lb/>opened a sharp fire on the enemy posted in their pits, and<lb/>soon made them start from them, they leaving one by one.<lb/>Our artillery then opened on them, and I saw one man<lb/>knocked plump over by one of our solid shots. When-<lb/>ever a rebel attempted to run from one pit to another,<lb/>or showed himself in any way, our men would open on<lb/>him, and if he was hit, a shout would be raised by every<lb/>one. It was pleasant for us w^ho were not under fire to<lb/>see the devils knocked over. Soon a few boat-loads of<lb/>men were thrown over the river. As soon as our men ap-<lb/>peared on the opposite bank, there was a stampede of the<lb/>rebels from all the rifle-pits and houses along the bank,<lb/>and then there was a race, our men running and firing<lb/>at the enemy as they went along. As we came to the dif-<lb/>ferent pits, our men would pull out the rebels, and send<lb/>them over the river. From one pit a white rag was shown,<lb/>and one of our men pulled three rebs out of it.

At 12 o'clock, I<lb/>reached camp, and immediately went to sleep, not having<lb/>had any for twenty-four hours. In the morning, I was sent<lb/>three different times to General Sedgwick: once with the<lb/>message that General Russell had refused to obey Gen-<lb/>eral Benham's orders; the second time, that General<lb/>Russell had refused to obey General B.'s orders, and<lb/>that he had put him under arrest; and the third time,<lb/>to ascertain how many bridges General S. wished.</p><p>Headquarters Engineer Brigade,<lb/>Camp near Falmouth, April 29, 1863.</p><p>Dear Father, Ã¢ÂÂ It is now 4.30 p.m., and we have fin-<lb/>ished five of our bridges. I will endeavor to give you a<lb/>brief account of everything that has happened since yes-<lb/>terday morning. Yesterday was cloudy and rainy, to-<lb/>wards afternoon and evening the weather growing very<lb/>misty, much to our joy, as last night was the night selected<lb/>to lay the bridges, two of which were to go down at<lb/>Bank's Ford; but these were afterwards shown and ex-<lb/>posed to view merely to deceive the rebs, without any<lb/>effort being made to lay them ; three more were to be laid<lb/>at Franklin's old place of crossing, and two a mile and a<lb/>half below Franklin's old place. The weather was perfect,<lb/>and could not have been better. A very thick fog hung<lb/>over the earth, completely hiding every object a few<lb/>yards distant. The boats were drawn by teams to within<lb/>a mile of the intended crossing place. From here they<lb/>were carried on poles to the river's bank, there being 75<lb/>men to each boat. This was done in order to get near the<lb/>enemy unheard, and take them if possible by surprise.<lb/>At 10 P.M. last night we left our camp, and went to</p><p/>

He and<lb/>General Benham made their arrangements, and to assist<lb/>General Benham, General Sedgwick sent an aide with<lb/>him. While giving him some instructions a short time<lb/>after. General Benham abused him shamefully without<lb/>the slightest cause. Soon after he got himself into a scrape<lb/>with General Brooks, and then with General Russell,<lb/>whom he placed under arrest. I was asked by two officers,<lb/>General Russell being one, whether General Benham was<lb/>not drunk. I said he was not, as I knew he took wine<lb/>only and not any liquors. Then, too, I was accustomed<lb/>to his swearing, etc., and thought nothing of it. Pretty<lb/>soon a captain came riding along on horseback, and Gen-<lb/>eral Benham opened on him, yelling out in a loud tone of<lb/>voice and Goddamning him. This, too, right on the bank<lb/>of the river and when he had just been cautioning every<lb/>one to keep quiet. I said to the general, " Don't call out<lb/>so loud, sir, the enemy can hear you." He still kept on,<lb/>however. All this time he was lying flat on the ground,<lb/>complaining of fatigue. He then sent me off to find a<lb/>Captain Reese, and when I came back he was gone, hav-<lb/>ing left directions for me to stay where his horse was. I<lb/>did not see him then for some time, when he came back<lb/>on a borrowed horse and reeling in his saddle. He said<lb/>to me in a thick voice, "Go tell General Sedgwick that<lb/>General Russell has disobeyed my orders," and kept re-<lb/>peating it. I went off with the message to General S.<lb/>During this last hour, everything had been going wrong.<lb/>There was no one to attend to the matter and General B.<lb/>confused and confounded everything.

Our men went right over and drove the enemy.<lb/>Meanwhile, I was on the go to General Sedgwick with<lb/>any number of messages from General B. When I came<lb/>back about 6 o'clock, I found General B. drunk as could<lb/>be, with a bloody cut over his left eye, and the blood all<lb/>over that side of his face and forming a disgusting sight<lb/>altogether. He had fallen down and cut his face. Soon<lb/>after he reeled in his saddle, and in trying to shake hands<lb/>with General Pratt, he fell right off his horse on to the<lb/>ground. I saw him do this. The soldiers picked him up,<lb/>and he mounted again, and rode round among the men,<lb/>swearing and trying to hurry matters, but only creating<lb/>trouble and making himself the laughing-stock of the<lb/>crowd. Finally three bridges were got across and then we<lb/>started for the two lower bridges where an unsuccessful<lb/>attempt had been made to cross in the morning. The<lb/>general had got moderately sober by that time, and began<lb/>to feel slightly ashamed of himself. I never in my life<lb/>have been so mortified and ashamed as I was this morn-<lb/>ing. I shall leave his staff as soon as possible, and I don't<lb/>see how he can escape a court-martial and dismissal from<lb/>the service. By sheer good luck we got the men across<lb/>the river and built the bridges. General Benham's being<lb/>drunk delayed the laying of the bridges for four hours ; his<lb/>mismanagement all but ruined the whole plan. Every one<lb/>there expected a disgraceful termination to the whole<lb/>affair, and as I have said, good luck only saved us, for the<lb/>rebels had two or three hours to prepare themselves, after<lb/>we arrived on the ground, when they should have had but<lb/>half an hour at the outside.</p><p>At the lower crossing, I witnessed one of the prettiest<lb/>sights of the war.

Our men in rifle-pits opened a heavy fire<lb/>on the enemy's sharpshooters, and soon one man jumped<lb/>out and ran, then another, and soon all along the line<lb/>men could be seen running from houses, ditches and rifle-<lb/>pits. Then our artillery would open and make the rascals<lb/>scatter. I saw one round shot knock a rebel head over<lb/>heels. Then, too, as the rebs ran from their hiding places,<lb/>our men would yell and cheer and send a perfect storm of<lb/>bullets after them. Soon our men rushed over in boats<lb/>and ran up the bank and began popping away at the rifle-<lb/>pits, houses, etc. Then came the grand skedaddle. From<lb/>every imaginable place came a rebel running for dear life,<lb/>with our men cheering at their heels and our artillery<lb/>helping to kick them along. Out of one large rifle-pit, I<lb/>saw 10 or 12 rebs taken prisoners. Out of another one, a<lb/>white rag would be raised and waved. Out of this came<lb/>three rebels. lOO prisoners were captured in all, and a<lb/>prettier sight I never saw in all my life. It is all very<lb/>pleasant to look on and see a fight when your side is whip-<lb/>ping, and you are not under fire, but it is not so pleasant<lb/>to be in it yourself. I think myself that this movement<lb/>here is a feint, whilst four of our corps cross at Bank's<lb/>or United States Ford. However, all will be settled in a<lb/>day or two, and at present everything looks bright for us.<lb/>I cannot imagine where General B. got his liquor.

The<lb/>order was revoked this evening for our crossing the river<lb/>to-night. The President and Halleck were here this<lb/>morning, and went away in the evening.

			<p>194 WAR DIARY AND LETTERS OF</p><p>Headquarters Engineer Brigade,<lb/>Camp near Falmouth, Va., May 7, 1863.</p><p>Dear Father, Ã¢ÂÂ We are back again from the front<lb/>and in our old position near headquarters of the army.<lb/>The whole army has likewise re-crossed the river, and are<lb/>occupying their old positions. The loss in killed, wounded<lb/>and prisoners will be about 10,000 men, as nearly as I can<lb/>judge. From what I can see and hear, I should think that<lb/>Hooker's plan was a good one, but he was unable to carry<lb/>it out on account of the superior numbers of the enemy<lb/>who were reinforced from Petersburg, Richmond, and,<lb/>I think, even from Tennessee. They have shown their<lb/>accustomed vigilance and activity, and have rather got<lb/>ahead of us again. Hooker's plan was to turn their left,<lb/>but they quickly massed their troops there, and by their<lb/>superior numbers and through the disgraceful behavior of<lb/>the Eleventh Corps, they compelled us to halt, and use the<lb/>much despised (by us) shovel and spade for our defence.<lb/>We were not whipped anywhere, and I think their loss was<lb/>much greater than our own. The chief mistake that was<lb/>made, was abandoning the heights of Fredericksburg af-<lb/>ter we had once taken them, and in underestimating the<lb/>force opposed to us. As far as I can see, the soldiers are<lb/>not disheartened, although the unsuccessful termination<lb/>of this affair will, I am afraid, injure General Hooker, who<lb/>was, as it were, on trial for ability to command this army.</p><p>I will try and give you an account of what our brigade<lb/>has done during this move. On the morning of the 29th,<lb/>5 bridges were laid. On the 30th, 2 bridges were taken<lb/>up and started for Bank's Ford, General B. and his staff<lb/>going with them.

Major Whittier of General<lb/>Sedgwick's staff has been trying to get me a place there,<lb/>but I am afraid that I can't get it, as General S. says that<lb/>it would be a rude thing for him to take me away from<lb/>General Benham.

Whittier is still trying for me, and I hope<lb/>will succeed. Please be careful and not have anything<lb/>written to General S., as I would prefer him to select me,<lb/>if he should do so, of his own choice and not through any<lb/>pressure brought to bear on him by his friends. I am very<lb/>much obliged to Miss Sedgwick, and am glad that she was<lb/>kind enough and took enough interest in me to write the<lb/>general, but of course I don't want him to think that I am<lb/>writing home and trying to get his friends to get the place<lb/>for me. You can understand how I feel, and of course will<lb/>do nothing out of the way in that respect.</p><p>General Benham is not in the habit of getting drunk,<lb/>as far as I know, and I do not think would have been so<lb/>the other night were it not for his fatigue, etc. Still, I am<lb/>not willing to be with any man who is at all liable to any<lb/>such failing. You know Rosecrans charged him with the<lb/>same thing. General Benham is a man whom every one<lb/>hates and laughs at, and I can assure you my place is<lb/>not pleasant with him.

My<lb/>position here is only as acting aide, but still it is on a<lb/>corps staff, and with a brave and fine general. I might<lb/>have obtained a position on Crawford's staff or on Gen-<lb/>eral Barnes's staff as a regular aide, but I preferred this<lb/>place. I told General Benham that I should like to leave<lb/>him, and soon after I met General Reynolds, to whom<lb/>I told the whole story. He told me that I acted perfectly<lb/>right throughout the whole affair. . . .</p><p>I see no prospect of our moving for some three or four<lb/>months. Our army is growing smaller every day and will<lb/>soon be reduced to 55,000 men fit for duty. Our loss in the<lb/>recent battles was between 17,000 and 18,000 men in<lb/>killed, wounded, and missing. This is true, although the<lb/>officer in command of this army has reported it at only<lb/>10,000 or 12,000, He has also reported that one cause of<lb/>his retreat was the rising of the river, on account of the<lb/>storm. Now, I know that the retreat was ordered long<lb/>before the storm came up, some 12 hours before. I was<lb/>at United States Ford when the storm began, and our<lb/>wagons and part of our artillery had started some time<lb/>before. I think it possible that General Hooker may have<lb/>been seriously affected by that shell which struck a pil-<lb/>lar he was leaning against and knocked him senseless. I<lb/>think that he may not have recovered from the shock for<lb/>some days and that he was not himself when he ordered<lb/>the retreat. His plan certainly seems to have been a good<lb/>one.</p><p>I wish you would send me the Saturday Evening<lb/>Gazette once in a while. It has some articles in it that<lb/>are quite interesting. . . .</p><p>General Reynolds has treated me very kindly through-</p><p/>

Also went to Engineer Brigade, and had<lb/>my horse shod. Saw Van B., etc. Captains Clapp and<lb/>Strang came over here in the evening.</p><p>Headquarters ist Army Corps, May 30, 1863.</p><p>Dear Father, Ã¢ÂÂ I received your letter yesterday in<lb/>regard to George, and will try and show it to Colonel<lb/>Hayes. I am sorry that the Governor has sent George's<lb/>name back, as Colonel Hayes took George almost solely<lb/>on my recommendation, as I had lost those you sent me,<lb/>and now I am afraid that he will think that the Gov-<lb/>ernor is opposed to George. I shall see him as soon as<lb/>I can get away from camp. The regiment (i8th) had no<lb/>chance to distinguish itself at Chancellorsville, and only<lb/>lost one man killed and half a dozen wounded, so that<lb/>there was no chance for any man to deserve promotion<lb/>for bravery.</p><p>I am very pleasantly situated now with General Rey-<lb/>nolds. The way I came to leave General Benham was as<lb/>follows : you know that I tried to get off his staff as soon<lb/>as that trouble occurred that night. For some time he<lb/>did not know that I was trying to leave him, and he did<lb/>not dare send me away, for fear that I would tell people<lb/>that I was sent away for saying that he was drunk. He<lb/>told an officer, whom I know quite well, and whom he did<lb/>not know I was acquainted with, that he should not touch<lb/>Weld this time, but that he would give it to him in a little<lb/>while. The old rascal meant to let this affair pass by, and<lb/>then try and catch me on something and play the mis-<lb/>chief with me. By some means or other, he got wind of<lb/>my efforts to get a position on another staff, Ã¢ÂÂ I think<lb/>myself that he listened to some conversation going on in</p><p/>

I can<lb/>tell you he is the most cunning and bitter man I know of.<lb/>I found out everything that he was planning, and so went<lb/>to him immediately and told him that thinking my pre-<lb/>sence would not be agreeable to him, after what occurred<lb/>between us in regard to that night, I had been trying to<lb/>obtain a position on another staff, and that I hoped to hear<lb/>the next day in regard to it; that if I was not success-<lb/>ful, I should like to return to my regiment. He said that<lb/>he supposed I had been trying to leave him, and that<lb/>he had selected another aide to fill my place. I then said<lb/>that I would like my resignation to take effect two days<lb/>from that time. He asked me where I was trying to go.<lb/>I said that I would rather not tell him. He then spoke<lb/>about what I had done, and said that I had committed a<lb/>gross violation of good faith, etc. I told him that I had<lb/>acted solely from what I considered my duty, and that<lb/>I felt that I had done perfectly right. I then went over<lb/>to headquarters of the Army of the Potomac, where I<lb/>met General Reynolds and told him that I had resigned<lb/>my place as A. D.

That when he heard that I had gone with Ben-<lb/>ham he felt very sorry, for he felt sure that I could not<lb/>get along with him. I told him the whole story, and<lb/>what I had done.

I think that the<lb/>enemy have been threatening our right flank, and that<lb/>we were to move up there, but as a division of the Fifth<lb/>Corps has already gone there, I think there will be no ne-<lb/>cessity for our moving for some time. I think the enemy<lb/>will assume the offensive before we do, and I am afraid<lb/>now that they will try and cut us off from Washington.</p><p>All General Benham's staff have left him except Cap-<lb/>tain Clapp, his A.

I think that we are waiting here simply to prevent the<lb/>rebels opposite from going to Vicksburg.

He was very kind indeed, and spoke<lb/>of receiving a letter from Miss Kate Sedgwick, in which<lb/>she spoke about me. As I left General S. the rain began<lb/>to pour down, and before I reached camp we had quite a<lb/>heavy thunder shower which was extremely welcome. In-<lb/>troduced myself to General Wright^ this afternoon. He<lb/>remembered me and was quite pleasant.</p><p>June 7, Ã¢ÂÂ The weather was much cooler to-day, owing<lb/>to the shower of last night. Spent the whole day in camp.<lb/>We are still under orders to move. James made up his<lb/>mind to stay with me, for $20 a month.</p><p>June 8. Ã¢ÂÂ Remained in camp until after dinner, when<lb/>I started for the Engineer Brigade. On the way there,<lb/>I met Clapp, Strang, and Nares, on their way down to<lb/>the river. I tried to get my horse shod at the Engineer<lb/>Brigade quarters, but the wind was so bad that it could<lb/>not be done. Came back to camp in about an hour. We<lb/>had a very pretty serenade last night from a violin and a<lb/>tambourine. Weather cool and pleasant. I heard that,<lb/>when we crossed the river this last time, some fifty pris-<lb/>oners were taken in the rifle-pits, belonging to the 2d<lb/>Florida. General Benham rushed up to them and asked<lb/>them whether they knew him. They said they did not.<lb/>Then he asked them if they did not know who built the<lb/>sea-wall at St. Augustine. One of them said that he had<lb/>heard it said that "red-haired Benham" built it. I hear<lb/>that General Benham now tells every one that he was<lb/>recognized by the rebels from their rifle-pits on the other<lb/>side of the river.</p><p>June 9.

The troops<lb/>halted here, and just before starting, a deserter was shot<lb/>in accordance with the sentence of a court-martial. He<lb/>belonged to General Wadsworth's division, and I carried<lb/>the order to the general to have the affair hurried up.^ At<lb/>12.30 we started for Deep Run, where the troops arrived<lb/>at 5 P.M., having made a march of 22 miles.

			<p>2i6 WAR DIARY AND LETTERS OF</p><p>Headquarters ist Army Corps,<lb/>Camp at Centreville, June i6, 1863.</p><p>Dear Father, Ã¢ÂÂ Last week we received orders to<lb/>move up the river and support the Fifth and Third Corps<lb/>which were guarding the fords. Accordingly we started<lb/>at daylight last Friday on our way, and marched until<lb/>four in the afternoon, camping at Deep Run, in exactly<lb/>the same spot that General Porter encamped last August<lb/>when on his way to join Pope. While on the march, and<lb/>just before reaching Berea Church, I met an orderly<lb/>coming from the headquarters of the Fifth Corps, with<lb/>my commission as a captain. I was quite glad to get it,<lb/>I assure you. At Berea Church we halted for an hour, and<lb/>just before starting, a deserter from an Indiana regiment<lb/>of General Wadsworth's division, was shot to death by<lb/>musketry, he having been found guilty by a court-martial.<lb/>I did not see the affair, as I had no desire to do so. The<lb/>distance marched the first day was about 23 miles. The<lb/>second day we pushed on to Bealeton Station, about 20<lb/>miles. On the way we passed another camp where Gen-<lb/>eral Porter stayed. About nine o'clock in the evening of<lb/>our arrival at Bealeton, I was sent back to General<lb/>Barnes, some 12 or 15 miles from us. As guerillas were<lb/>round about, it was rather unpleasant, but I saw nothing<lb/>of them. Here at Bealeton we received orders to march<lb/>to Centreville and take up our position there. General<lb/>Reynolds then had command of five corps. General<lb/>Hooker, with the three remaining corps, taking the route<lb/>by Dumfries. From Bealeton our corps moved to Manas-<lb/>sas Junction, over twenty miles. Our headquarters were<lb/>at Catlett's Station. Yesterday we arrived here at Cen-<lb/>treville, soon to be on the march again, I imagine, for<lb/>Pennsylvania, or the Valley of the Shenandoah. I hear<lb/>that the enemy have whipped Milroy, and I suppose that</p><p/>

I told him I had<lb/>not, and he sent me to Major Lawrence, who provided<lb/>me with a very nice dinner. I started back at 6 p.m., and<lb/>reached camp at Herndon's Station at 11.30, having a<lb/>guide and a pass provided me by Colonel Gray, of the<lb/>4th Michigan, who were on picket near Fairfax Court<lb/>House. The guide had strange stories to tell about the<lb/>guerilla Mosby. In all I travelled about 60 miles to-day,<lb/>and was pretty well used up, as the day was extremely<lb/>warm and sultry. Found camp at Herndon Station.</p><p>[In connection with Mosby, an interesting story was<lb/>told of Major Eraser. He was out scouting after Mosby,<lb/>and as they were passing a house close by the road, a<lb/>sergeant, with the troops with him, saw a man in a gray<lb/>uniform standing at the window of the house. The ser-<lb/>geant drew his pistol and fired. He instantly went into<lb/>the house, and there was a Confederate on the floor with<lb/>his cloak drawn over his face. He said, "I am mortally<lb/>wounded, please leave me alone." They pulled up his<lb/>waistcoat and saw a hole right through his abdomen,<lb/>where he had been shot, and they left him, supposing he<lb/>was dying. Five minutes after, they found it was Mosby.<lb/>They turned around and went back, but he had been<lb/>taken away by his friends. It turned out that the bullet<lb/>had only penetrated the outer skin, followed around, and<lb/>come out at the back, so that Mr. Mosby got well and<lb/>tormented us as usual. Had Eraser captured him, he<lb/>would have got a brigadier general's commission.]</p><p>June 18.

I was going to start for our headquarters at<lb/>the same time, and with Major Stirling, but on account<lb/>of General Butterfield asking me to dinner, I waited fif-<lb/>teen minutes. It rained in the afternoon and during the<lb/>night, being the first rain we have had for some time. All<lb/>the crops through the country where we have been, are<lb/>suffering terribly on account of the drought. The general<lb/>was going to send me to headquarters again this afternoon,<lb/>but just as I was starting an orderly came from there,<lb/>which saved me the trouble. I drew a government horse<lb/>to-day for temporary use, until my mare's back gets well.</p><p>[A day or two after writing this entry I found that two<lb/>staff officers belonging to diff"erent corps headquarters,<lb/>who had lunched with me at headquarters of the Army<lb/>of the Potomac on the i8th, had got into trouble. One<lb/>started a little after lunch, and wanted me to go along<lb/>with him. I said no, I thought I would wait a few min-<lb/>utes and have a smoke. In about fifteen or twenty min-<lb/>utes I started. The other aide wanted me to wait and<lb/>go with him in half an hour. I said no, I thought I had<lb/>better go ahead; so I started. Before starting I was<lb/>cautioned by General Butterfield to be very careful, as<lb/>Mosby's guerillas were all around the army; and as soon<lb/>as I got to our outposts I was to demand an escort and<lb/>carry them with me to camp. Accordingly I started, as<lb/>nearly as I can remember, about 5 o'clock in the after-<lb/>noon. I rode until pretty nearly dark, when I met our<lb/>outpost. I gave my orders to the colonel for an escort,<lb/>and he gave me a lieutenant and, I think, five or six<lb/>men. By the time we were pretty well started on our<lb/>way, darkness had set in.

We<lb/>passed one house, and he said that one of Mosby's lieu-<lb/>tenants lived there, who captured one of our sergeants<lb/>the other day. A little farther on, he said, "We had a<lb/>fight with Mosby here the other day. He tried to sur-<lb/>prise us."</p><p>I was in a state of nervous tension that one can hardly<lb/>realize. I had one hand on my horse's reins, and with the<lb/>other I grasped my pistol, ready to shoot in case we were<lb/>attacked. As we rode along, we could hear the katydids<lb/>singing, and occasionally an owl hooting, or some of the<lb/>numerous midnight noises that one always hears on a<lb/>summer's night. The lieutenant said to me: "The hoot-<lb/>ing of the owl is one of the favorite calls of Mosby's<lb/>men." Then I would get a little more stirred up, if pos-<lb/>sible, and a little more nervous. Finally, though, we got<lb/>through all right, after one of the most exciting rides I<lb/>ever had in my life. In the morning our head teamster<lb/>was up in a cherry tree about two hundred yards from<lb/>headquarters, when Mosby came along right in our camp,<lb/>made him a prisoner, and took him off.

Ã¢ÂÂ Received orders early this morning to be<lb/>ready to move, and at about 8 o'clock we started for<lb/>Young's Ford, three miles below Edward's Ferry. When<lb/>near the ferry we found that the ford was too deep for<lb/>infantry, so we moved for the ferry itself, where they<lb/>have a pontoon bridge across. We met Birney's corps<lb/>just before turning off from the pike to the ferry. Here<lb/>General Reynolds took command of the First, Third,<lb/>and Eleventh Corps. We reached the river just where<lb/>Goose Creek runs in, and crossed the creek on a pontoon<lb/>bridge, and then the Potomac on another. I found Cap-<lb/>tain Reese and Captain Turnbull here, and after a little<lb/>while we went up to their tents on the hill, which rises<lb/>from the river. A new bridge was soon finished here, so<lb/>that we had two going. The view from here was very fine,<lb/>and the troops crossing made a very beautiful scene. Up<lb/>to this time we had had a very dusty march of eight<lb/>miles, but about 3 p.m. it began to rain, and soon settled<lb/>into a drizzle which lasted all night. Our headquarters<lb/>were established about a mile and a half from Poolesville,<lb/>Maryland. General Reynolds rode into the town and<lb/>saw General French. I heard that the 2d Massachusetts<lb/>Cavalry were near here, and on looking for them, found<lb/>them. I saw Colonel LowelP and Major Forbes,^ both<lb/>looking very well.</p><p>June 26. Ã¢ÂÂ We got up and breakfasted at daylight.<lb/>It was a most dismal morning, being drizzly and thor-<lb/>oughly uncomfortable.

Barnesville is a small,<lb/>old-fashioned town, with one or two neat little cottages<lb/>in it, with pretty flower-gardens in front; quite a contrast<lb/>to anything we had seen in Virginia. Some of the houses<lb/>had overhanging eaves, others piazzas all round, and on<lb/>the main street there was a well with windlass and wheel,<lb/>quite different from anything I ever saw in New England.<lb/>It seemed more like my idea of a European town than<lb/>an American one. Like almost all Maryland towns the<lb/>houses were all on one main street. From Barnesville we<lb/>went on to Adamstown, a small way-station on the Bal-<lb/>timore &amp; Ohio R. R. From here we went to Jefferson,<lb/>lying on the other side, and at the foot of the Little Ca-<lb/>toctin range. The scenery all along the route was very<lb/>beautiful. We passed neat farmhouses with whitewashed<lb/>palings, and through fields of wheat, rye, etc., almost<lb/>ready to be gathered. From the top of Little Catoctin<lb/>the view was splendid. The fertile valley lying between<lb/>the Little Catoctin and South Mountain ranges presented<lb/>an appearance truly delightful to our eyes, which had<lb/>been disgusted and wearied by the monotonous and un-<lb/>cultivated soil of the Old Dominion. Here acres upon<lb/>acres of clover, wheat, oats, etc., were spread out to our<lb/>view, seeming like a perfect paradise. We found that<lb/>Jefferson was a strong Union town, with many pretty<lb/>houses, and some three or four churches. We pitched, or<lb/>rather established, our headquarters in a house at the<lb/>west end of the town, and here I slept in a bed, for the<lb/>first time since I have been in the field. Our wagons did<lb/>not get up with us. We travelled about 27 miles to-day,<lb/>and most of the time in a drenching rain. I ate some<lb/>cherries, the first I had tasted this season, in Jefferson.<lb/>General Reynolds still has command of three corps.</p><p/>

The Administration would not<lb/>let Hooker withdraw our forces from Harper's Ferry, nor<lb/>would they give him any reinforcements from Washing-<lb/>ton or Baltimore, and so he properly resigned.

Here we have<lb/>the whole rebel force in Pennsylvania, and greatly out-<lb/>numbering us, and yet they persist in keeping a large<lb/>force at both of these places, in order to prevent the<lb/>Secessionists from "robbing the stores."

I see Hooker doing exactly what</p><p>^ I was with General Reynolds w^hen he received the order appointing<lb/>Meade to the command of the army.

Then he Ã¢ÂÂ to speak in<lb/>plain English Ã¢ÂÂ roundly damned the Chief of Staff,<lb/>whom he had inherited from his predecessor, for his slow-<lb/>ness in getting out orders. He said that two or three<lb/>days before, he had arranged for a plan of battle, and it<lb/>had taken so long to get the orders out that now it was all<lb/>useless. From what I have heard since I suppose this<lb/>referred to the proposed plan of battle at Pipe's Creek.<lb/>At all events, after this tirade against the Chief of Staff<lb/>of the Army, he summoned all his aides out to hurry up<lb/>Hancock and all the other commands. From what Gen-<lb/>eral Reynolds said to me, it was evident that he appreci-<lb/>ated the importance of holding Gettysburg and the<lb/>heights. General Reynolds also told me to tell General<lb/>Meade that he would barricade the street at Gettysburg<lb/>and hold the enemy back as long as he could.

He galloped back<lb/>towards our troops about 2 miles off, and on the way<lb/>asked me if my horse was in good condition. As I had<lb/>travelled 30 miles the day before, I said that she was not,<lb/>but that I would go anywhere with her that he wished<lb/>me to. He told me to ride as quickly as possible to Gen-<lb/>eral Meade and tell him that the enemy were advancing<lb/>in strong force on the town, and that he was afraid they<lb/>would get there before he did, but that he would fight<lb/>them all the way through the town, and keep them back<lb/>as long as possible. General Meade was at Taneytown,<lb/>14 miles distant. I started off on a gallop and got there<lb/>in an hour and twenty minutes, very good time consider-<lb/>ing that my horse was so used up. I delivered the message<lb/>to General Meade, and started back, and on my way back<lb/>met General Reynolds's body in an ambulance. I was<lb/>very much shocked and felt very badly about it. The<lb/>general, it seems, hurried his troops up and was getting<lb/>them in position on this range I spoke of, when the enemy<lb/>opened on them ; and while the general was rallying some<lb/>of his men, he was shot in the back of his head, killing<lb/>him almost instantly. A braver man or a better soldier<lb/>than General R. never lived. He was a very reserved<lb/>man, but still a kind one, and one for whom I had the ut-<lb/>most respect and regard. His kindness to me I shall never<lb/>forget.</p><p>At the time he was shot, the general had command of<lb/>the three Corps, the First, Eleventh, and Third. The<lb/>First was coming on to the ground, the Eleventh near at<lb/>hand, and the Third some ten miles distant. I offered my<lb/>services to General Howard, who took command, and was</p><p/>

We took position,<lb/>however, on a high hill on the south side of the town,<lb/>where there was a cemetery, and along a stone wall in<lb/>front our men were posted, with the batteries behind<lb/>them.

The town is<lb/>just like all Maryland towns. After entering the village,<lb/>we turned to the right, and crossed the Antietam on the<lb/>Hagerstown pike. We formed our line on the left of the<lb/>Eleventh Corps, which formed our extreme right resting<lb/>on Antietam Creek. On our left we joined the Sixth<lb/>Corps. Our men built rifle-pits all along the line, and<lb/>were prepared for an attack, although these measures<lb/>were merely precautionary. Our line was a very strong<lb/>one indeed, running parallel for a long distance to the<lb/>Hagerstown and Sharpsburg pike, and then crossing it<lb/>on the left, and running towards the river. The enemy's<lb/>line was not much over 1000 yards from ours, the skir-<lb/>mishers of both parties being sharply engaged almost all<lb/>the time.

We finally forded the creek at<lb/>Benton's Mill. Major Russell and Colonel Sanderson<lb/>were gobbled near this ford by about twelve of Mosby's<lb/>men, and taken through Middleburg on their way to<lb/>Warrenton. After reaching M., I was sent to headquar-<lb/>ters of the Army of the Potomac, and found them at<lb/>Union, 6 miles distant. Received orders to stay where we<lb/>were to-morrow. Baird is A. A. G.^</p><p>July 21. Ã¢ÂÂ We remained in camp all day on the east-<lb/>ern outskirts of the town. I went down into the town and<lb/>seized a man named Chancellor to act as a guide. I also<lb/>gobbled a negro living on Mr. English's place. I put<lb/>them both under guard. Two drummer boys who were<lb/>captured by Mosby yesterday came back this afternoon,<lb/>having been paroled. They reported Mosby as being<lb/>about 8 miles from here, and as having robbed Russell<lb/>and Sanderson of all their money, etc. A man named<lb/>Nolan was arrested and brought in, accused of having<lb/>helped Mosby take the drummer boys. The weather was<lb/>pleasant.</p><p>July 22. Ã¢ÂÂ As we did not receive any orders to move<lb/>last night, we supposed we were safe for to-day, but</p><p>1 As we were starting out this morning, we got one or two hundred yards<lb/>ahead of the corps, and looking to the left, I saw fifty or sixty Confederate<lb/>cavalry in the field, not more than two or three hundred yards to our left.<lb/>I showed them to the general, and he told me to take our headquarters<lb/>guard and go after them. As soon as they saw us, they retired in short order<lb/>into the woods. I followed them for about a mile, but could not get them.<lb/>I found a hospital for sick horses belonging to Mosby, but could accomplish<lb/>nothing, so returned. When we got to Goose Creek, the general wanted to<lb/>cross over. As we were about a quarter of a mile ahead of the corps, I begged<lb/>him to wait, and he did so. Lucky he did, for Major Russell and Colonel<lb/>Sanderson, who did cross a few minutes ahead of us, were captured by<lb/>Mosby.</p><p/>

We started as soon as possible,<lb/>compelling an old darkey and a man named Simmons to<lb/>act as guides. We had a very pleasant march of about<lb/>9 miles, reaching White Plains about 8 p.m. On our way<lb/>we found traces of Mosby's corrals, etc. The day was<lb/>pleasant.</p><p>July 23. Ã¢ÂÂ Captain Mitchell arrived here at 5 a.m.,<lb/>with orders for us to move to Warrenton, 13 miles from<lb/>White Plains. General Kenly led. We reached Warren-<lb/>ton about 3 P.M. ; Mosby's men were ahead of us all along<lb/>the route. We met the cavalry train parked about 8 miles<lb/>from Warrenton. Our corps was camped on the Waterloo<lb/>and Culpeper roads. Our headquarters are at the Warren<lb/>Green Hotel. A year ago next November I passed<lb/>through here with General Porter on the way to Washing-<lb/>ton. He had just been relieved, and was accompanied as<lb/>far as this hotel by General Hooker. We saw Burnside at<lb/>the hotel, General Halleck, and numerous other generals.<lb/>There has been a great change since then.

Ã¢ÂÂ The general sent Lieutenant Carson out to<lb/>Waterloo with 20 cavalrymen, and five companies of in-<lb/>fantry as a support.

They<lb/>said that when they left Culpeper there were no troops<lb/>there. The firing was from our cavalry fighting infantry,<lb/>near Annisville. General Ingalls arrived here this evening,<lb/>and I obtained a paper from one of his party, the first I<lb/>have seen for a week. I took a walk through the town<lb/>during the afternoon. Saw some pretty girls, who would<lb/>not even glance at us, however. The town is quite a<lb/>pretty one, and has some neat cottages in it. Some of them<lb/>reminded me very much of the houses on the Beverly<lb/>shore. The population of Warrenton before the war was<lb/>2000. At present it cannot be over 600, and these mostly<lb/>women and children. Almost all the families here are in<lb/>mourning, but almost invariably, so I am told, give as the<lb/>reason for wearing black, that some aged relative has<lb/>died. I suppose they think that the Yankees would be<lb/>glad to know of any one being killed in battle, and so<lb/>refuse to tell.</p><p>July 25. Ã¢ÂÂ Received orders to march at daylight<lb/>this morning for Warrenton Junction. Started as ordered,<lb/>and reached there by noon, a distance of 10 miles. Be-<lb/>fore leaving in the morning, Mrs. Smith, wife of Extra<lb/>Billy,^ came up to the hotel, to try to get back her cattle,<lb/>which General Cutler took. I believe she was successful.<lb/>She said that she hoped Extra B. would be inaugurated<lb/>Governor of the State and the Union in January next.<lb/>We found the Eleventh Corps just arriving at the Junc-<lb/>tion as we came in.

When we arrived there<lb/>we found that we had about 100 cavalry and some sharp-<lb/>shooters across the river. The enemy retired without<lb/>firing a shot, being only videttes. The engineers began<lb/>to lay the bridge soon after we got there, and as soon as<lb/>it was finished the cavalry began crossing. As soon as<lb/>they had sufficient force over, a squadron went off to the<lb/>right, and deployed as skirmishers, advancing up the hill<lb/>very prettily, but meeting no enemy.

At the<lb/>time I left the army I expected to be back again, with my<lb/>regiment full, in the course of three months at the out-<lb/>side. I am now well satisfied at being here at all with my<lb/>present rank.</p><p>When I reached home, matters looked badly enough<lb/>for the regiment. Not a man enlisted, the recruiting,<lb/>or rather attempts at it, having been going on for three<lb/>weeks at least. My commission bore date of July 22,<lb/>1863, but I must say that for three or four months from<lb/>that date, I had little expectation of ever being an officer<lb/>in the United States service with that rank. I never<lb/>should have taken the place, had not my old chum Harry<lb/>Egbert persuaded me to do so.</p><p>Recruiting for our regiment began in reality about the<lb/>first of November, under the call of October 17, 1863, for<lb/>300,000 men, stimulated by the promise of extra bounties<lb/>from the State. It continued very fairly until about the<lb/>first of March, when all our recruiting officers were called<lb/>in. On January 2, 1864, I was mustered in as lieutenant<lb/>colonel by Lieutenant Robert P. McKibben, 4th U. S.<lb/>Infantry. The 4th of January, 1864, was my twenty-<lb/>second birthday.</p><p>On Sunday, the 20th of March, 1864, after numerous<lb/>false starts in accordance with the usual custom, the regi-<lb/>ment finally started from Readville on its way to Anna-<lb/>polis. I was glad enough to get off, as the men were con-<lb/>stantly deserting while in camp at Readville, and were all<lb/>the time on guard or detailed, so that we could neither<lb/>drill nor discipline them properly. The day before we<lb/>started, over thirty gallons of liquor were confiscated on<lb/>the persons of people coming to see their friends or rela-<lb/>tions in Readville.</p><p/>

The ground is dry and easily drained, with water,<lb/>etc., within convenient distance. The railroad runs within<lb/>a fourth of a mile of our camp, making it very convenient<lb/>for us to get our supplies.</p><p>We left camp, as you know, on Sunday morning, the<lb/>men and officers being in the best of spirits, and with but<lb/>few of the men, I am glad to say, drunk. The day before<lb/>we left, over forty gallons of liquor were confiscated at<lb/>General Peirce's headquarters, being found on the persons<lb/>of the soldiers' friends, or rather enemies. We reached<lb/>Groton at 3 p.m. without losing a man. At every place we<lb/>stopped, the officers and guards got out, and prevented<lb/>any civilians from having access to the men. In this way<lb/>we managed to keep all liquor away from the soldiers. At<lb/>Groton we shipped the regiment on board the Plymouth<lb/>Rock and reached Jersey City by 2.30 a.m., experiencing<lb/>no trouble except from the boat-hands selling rum to the<lb/>men. At Jersey City we had to wait until 10.30 A.M. be-<lb/>fore we could get the regiment on board the cars and<lb/>started. We lost but two men here. We reached Camden<lb/>at about 7 p.m. with all our men except one. At Newark a<lb/>citizen was shot by one of the officers for refusing to go<lb/>away from the cars, where he was selling liquor, and for<lb/>throwing stones at the officer.

I demolished a<lb/>liquor shop in Philadelphia and took the proprietor pris-<lb/>oner. I had him hand-cuffed and taken on to Baltimore,<lb/>where I had half his head and beard shaved and then<lb/>turned him over to the provost marshal. At Philadelphia<lb/>the colonel and quartermaster left us, and went on to<lb/>Baltimore to provide transportation for the regiment, and<lb/>therefore I had command. After taking our supper here,<lb/>we marched to Philadelphia and Baltimore depot, where<lb/>we took freight cars for Baltimore. We arrived there at<lb/>12 and found the colonel waiting for us. As a dinner was<lb/>promised us here at the Union Rooms, we marched some<lb/>two miles from the depot to the place, where we found<lb/>that we had been taken in, for no dinner was ready, so like<lb/>the king of old we marched down the hill again. We took<lb/>the steamer Columbia at Baltimore about 2 p.m. and<lb/>started for Annapolis, reaching there at 6.30 p.m. in a<lb/>driving snow-storm. We disembarked as soon as possible,<lb/>and marched to what are called the College Green Bar-<lb/>racks, where the paroled prisoners are kept for the first<lb/>day or two after their arrival. We found only four of the<lb/>barracks empty, and had to pack our men in them, put-<lb/>ting four hundred where two [hundred] are usually put.<lb/>Still it was much better this way than without any shelter<lb/>at all, for the night was bitter cold and the wind keen<lb/>and sharp. In the morning we made arrangements with<lb/>Major Chamberlain to provide our men with hot coffee<lb/>and meat, until we could draw our rations. Major Cham-<lb/>berlain is in the 1st Massachusetts Cavalry and in charge<lb/>of the parole camp. He was very kind and obliging to us,<lb/>for without his aid we could have done nothing for our<lb/>men, and should have been obliged to have seen them</p><p/>

One of the worst cases<lb/>in the regiment, named Casey, I had tied up by the<lb/>thumbs, and gagged. He then kicked an ofhcer there, and<lb/>I said to him, " Casey, I will shoot you if you do that<lb/>again." Another officer came by and he kicked him, and<lb/>I drew that pistol Uncle Oliver gave me and fired at him<lb/>twice. The first shot went through his arm, in the biceps,<lb/>without touching the bone. The second hit the bayonet<lb/>in his mouth by which he was gagged, and dropped into<lb/>his stocking. The bayonet saved his life, for the shot<lb/>would have gone through his head otherwise. I meant to<lb/>kill him, and was very sorry I did not succeed.

I<lb/>called him up a few days after shooting him, and told him<lb/>that I meant to have killed him when I fired at him, but<lb/>that if he would promise to let rum alone, I would release<lb/>him from the guard-house. I might have had him tried<lb/>by court-martial and shot, but I thought I would give<lb/>him another chance. I have no doubt now but that the<lb/>fellow will make a good soldier. He and other men in the<lb/>regiment know that I will enforce discipline at all hazards,<lb/>and that if I say that I shall shoot them, it will be done.<lb/>I am firm and strict with all but always endeavor to be<lb/>just and to discriminate between the totally bad and<lb/>those temporarily led away.'

We are having a continued<lb/>storm here, without the slightest cessation. I don't think<lb/>we have had three pleasant days since we have been here.<lb/>They have with two exceptions been snow-storms, but<lb/>the snow quickly melted away. The only difference be-<lb/>tween here and home is that it is much more moderate<lb/>here than there. I suppose you have had snow all the<lb/>time.</p><p>Our camp here is much better than the Readville one.<lb/>The soil here is sandy, so that the water is quickly ab-<lb/>sorbed.

I am glad of it, as he is much needed here.<lb/>I see no preparations made for our leaving here and imag-<lb/>ine that we shall remain here some time. . . .</p><p>The chief trouble that we have from our men now is<lb/>caused by liquor. They manage to get hold of it some<lb/>way, and get drunk. We have very little trouble with<lb/>them, however, in any way.</p><p>I have not touched a drop of liquor or wine since leav-<lb/>ing Readville, and don't mean to while I am with the<lb/>regiment. I don't think it safe for an officer to do so,<lb/>especially one who has so many lives in his charge. . . .</p><p>Thursday, April 14. Ã¢ÂÂ Court-martial took up the case<lb/>of Sergeant George Young. Did not finish it. Some of our<lb/>cases are to come up to-morrow. Day pleasant. Took<lb/>command of dress-parade this afternoon. The regiment<lb/>has improved a great deal since coming here. Had a<lb/>game of whist in the evening with Mr. Lipp and<lb/>others.</p><p>Friday, April 15.

I don't believe it,<lb/>although I think it highly probable that the negro division<lb/>of the corps may be left to do guard-duty. We marched<lb/>from Fairfax C.

Ã¢ÂÂ Left camp at about 7.15 a.m. and<lb/>marched to Catlett's Station, where I saw Billy Swan ^<lb/>and Captain O'Beirne of the 14th Regiment of Regulars.<lb/>From there we marched to Warrenton Junction, then to<lb/>Licking Run, some two miles farther. Here we were<lb/>encamped for the night, having marched about 13 miles.<lb/>We threw out pickets, etc., to protect ourselves from<lb/>guerillas, but were not troubled by them. It seems that<lb/>we are to guard the railroad from Catlett's Station to<lb/>Rappahannock Station, relieving General Griffin's di-<lb/>vision of the Fifth Corps. We expect to remain in camp<lb/>here for a day or two. Weather pleasant. We have been<lb/>very fortunate in our march, having had but one rainy<lb/>night for a week.</p><p>Saturday, April 30. Ã¢ÂÂ Left camp about 9.15 a.m. and<lb/>marched to Bealeton Station, where we took possession of<lb/>the 4th Michigan camp. Met Monteith on the way up<lb/>and Batchelder^ at Bealeton Station. Went up to General<lb/>Griffin's headquarters and saw Barnard and Davis. Then<lb/>saw Captain Martin and offered him $275 for his horse,</p><p>^ W. W.

It was one continual roll, at long in-<lb/>tervals broken by the loud booming of a cannon. We<lb/>went up what was called the Brock Road. We kept<lb/>receiving orders from Generals Hancock, Birney and<lb/>others, so that "things were slightly mixed."

We advanced, being the third line, some half<lb/>a mile without much opposition. We were engaged in this<lb/>way about three hours, from 8.45 until 11.45, losing only<lb/>about six men. At about 12 the enemy flanked our left,<lb/>and we were sent to oppose their advance. We were<lb/>posted In a ditch along the side of the road, and on the<lb/>left.

We were in<lb/>action about three and a half hours. Saw John Perry just<lb/>as I was going into the fight. Got a bullet through my<lb/>boot-leg, while we were retreating. The fire was the heav-<lb/>iest I have ever been under. Several of my men, that<lb/>I drove out from behind trees, were killed by my side.<lb/>Trees were cut down by the bullets, and bark was<lb/>knocked into my face time and again by the bullets. We<lb/>were not able to get poor Charley Griswold's body. Sent<lb/>out for it, and also for Zab Adams's, but could find no<lb/>traces of either. The last words that Charley said to me<lb/>were, " Poor Bartlett is killed." ^ The result of the day's<lb/>fight was that we gained ground all along the line, cap-<lb/>turing several hundred prisoners. The enemy partially<lb/>turned our right.</p><p>[When we were advancing on this morning we passed<lb/>several rebels lying on the ground, who had been wounded<lb/>a little while before.

As soon as we had<lb/>gone fifty yards or so, the fellow we had given water to<lb/>drew himself up and shot one of our men.

Was ordered to<lb/>keep the brigade in reserve. His division, together with<lb/>Lesure's brigade, was posted on the heights beyond the<lb/>Nye River, and about a mile from Spottsylvania. Be-<lb/>yond we could see the rebel lines and the rebel troops<lb/>moving, together with their trains. The corps lost about<lb/>200 men in to-day's fight.

I then took command<lb/>of the regiment, which had to fall back soon on account<lb/>of being flanked.

Here we were<lb/>under a very heavy cross fire of canister and musketry,<lb/>and it was impossible to get the men forward. I could<lb/>not blame them much, for the limbs, and even trees, were<lb/>cut down like grkss, and the place was most decidedly un-<lb/>comfortable. I sent the sergeant major to General Ledlie<lb/>with the information that we could not take the works.<lb/>He returned, but could get no instructions. I ordered<lb/>the men forward again in vain, and in endeavoring to get<lb/>up the 35th as a support, they ran away, for which I did<lb/>not blame them.

He got about 50 or 60 of his men together; I had<lb/>my colors in my hand getting my men together, and when<lb/>I had collected about the same number. General Mahone<lb/>came up within forty yards of us and gave us a volley.<lb/>I was turning, calling some of my men back at the mo-<lb/>ment the volley was fired, and got a bullet through my<lb/>coat that scratched my side for about three inches and<lb/>drew blood and raised an enormous welt, from which I was<lb/>sore for a week or ten days.

My only idea was to try and get in-<lb/>side our lines before I dropped. As soon as I got behind<lb/>the temporary works we had thrown up, I pulled up my<lb/>shirt and found I was only scratched, and I felt quite<lb/>happy.

All<lb/>orders were whispered to the men, and we were told, in<lb/>marching forward, to try and not even break the branches<lb/>on the ground that we were treading on. It was a beau-<lb/>tiful summer's day, birds were singing and the sun shim-<lb/>mering and shining through the trees. Everything as far<lb/>as nature was concerned was as far removed from the<lb/>idea or appearance of war as it possibly could be.

I am thankful to say that so<lb/>far I have escaped both shell, bullet and sickness, al-<lb/>though the campaign has been by far the most severe that<lb/>I have ever undergone. Our food has consisted of hard-<lb/>tack and beef, when we could get it, with occasional vari-<lb/>ations of salt pork. Yesterday, though, my boy foraged<lb/>some green peas, and I had a regular feast, I can tell you.<lb/>Our shelter has generally been the "broad canopy of hea-<lb/>ven" through all weathers, although I have been able<lb/>occasionally to indulge in a tent fly. How you would<lb/>laugh at home to see how dirty, brown and ragged we are.<lb/>I had to go without a change of clothing for over twenty<lb/>days, and during that time was unable to take my clothes<lb/>off, even.</p><p>I have had three as narrow escapes as I ever wish to<lb/>have. The last one was three or four days ago, when a<lb/>i2-pounder shell that had not exploded, passed close by<lb/>me, grazing my coat cape.</p><p>Everything looks as if we had settled down to a regular<lb/>siege of Richmond. We shall probably have any amount<lb/>of digging to do and, I hope, some rest. We can't get<lb/>hold of our wagons though, which makes it very incon-<lb/>venient.</p><p>I suppose you know that I am commissioned as colonel,<lb/>Raish as lieutenant colonel and Captain Putnam as<lb/>major. I am afraid that I cannot get mustered as colonel,<lb/>as I have not enough men. . . .</p><p>Tuesday, June 7. Ã¢ÂÂ Received orders to move about<lb/>10 A.M.

We have now been over 37 days marching and<lb/>fighting.</p><p>From what I can see, I do not think that we shall be in<lb/>Richmond in much under two months. The papers give<lb/>too rose-colored a view of matters, and I am afraid that<lb/>they have raised public expectation too high. We are<lb/>blocked here for the present, having butted against Lee's<lb/>fortifications in vain. I do not feel discouraged about it,<lb/>as I feel quite confident of ultimate, but not of immediate<lb/>success. I expect daily to see the whole army start for the<lb/>James River. When once there, inside our fortifications,<lb/>we can afTord to dig and wait. Here, in our present po-<lb/>sition, I am afraid that delay is dangerous, for Lee will<lb/>use some such plan as he did against McClellan, We<lb/>number probably more men than he does, but they are not<lb/>the Army of the Potomac, which is pretty well used up.</p><p/>

The men had broken ranks, and they gave chase and<lb/>caught him, and he was given to me and I had him broiled<lb/>for my supper. Henry Dalton came over also and gave<lb/>us some hard- tack. Adjutant Lipp caught a box- turtle<lb/>and had him roasted. Late in the evening we all of us had<lb/>plenty to eat.]</p><p>June 15.

We received orders to be ready to<lb/>move at 6 p.m., and after issuing four days' rations of<lb/>ham and bread, and two of coffee and sugar, we started<lb/>for the river [James], crossing on a pontoon bridge 2100<lb/>feet long.

Colonel Gould had command of the<lb/>first line, giving me command of the ist brigade. At<lb/>about 6 P.M. we charged forward, and under a heavy fire,<lb/>about 200 yards, and took the rebel pits, losing heavily<lb/>in doing it. We were, as usual, under a destructive en-<lb/>filading fire. We held the pits some two or three hours,<lb/>when the rebels charged on us, driving us from the pits<lb/>into our lines again. Our men were without ammunition,<lb/>and fell back on that account. We mustered 130 men in<lb/>the brigade after the fight.

I believe that<lb/>General Ledlie, the officer of whom I am speaking, is<lb/>dead, and as this diary is never to become public pro-<lb/>perty, it does not seem unfair for me to tell the truth here<lb/>and to state some facts. General Ledlie was drunk on<lb/>May 24, at the North Anna. There were several times<lb/>that he had had too much to drink during the campaign.<lb/>I think the poor man was a coward and took the liquor<lb/>to try and fortify himself for the fight. Anyway, in the<lb/>charge that was made this day, when I found that we<lb/>were to make the charge, I made all my men take the<lb/>caps off their guns. I knew from previous experiences in<lb/>the campaign that, if we made a charge and the men had<lb/>the caps on their guns, when we got within a few yards</p><p>^ Sergeant-major, recently appointed an officer. I believe he had not re-<lb/>ceived his commission.</p><p/>

The only chance<lb/>was to keep on the steady jump and rush them right over<lb/>the works. I told my men what was to be done, and said,<lb/>"When you get the order to charge, you leg it like the<lb/>devil. Don't stop for anything, just run as tight as you<lb/>can " ; and they did so, and went swarming over the rebel<lb/>works, capturing lots of their men, with lots of ammuni-<lb/>tion and knapsacks and all their fixings. Then came the<lb/>end, which is always likely to happen when one's com-<lb/>manding officer is incompetent through drink or anything<lb/>else. After holding the place for three hours, we ran out<lb/>of ammunition. I sent back messenger after messenger,<lb/>begging them to send us ammunition. The men were there<lb/>exposed to a heavy fire, both enfilading and direct from<lb/>the front, and without ammunition to reply to it. It was<lb/>dark before we were driven back, and then, as I have said<lb/>in my diary, I could hear the rebel officer giving the order<lb/>to his men: "Steady, men, steady!" while they were ad-<lb/>vancing on us. We had to retreat, as we had nothing to<lb/>shoot with. When we got back over the plain into the<lb/>valley from which we had started, Ã¢ÂÂ for we were formed<lb/>in a ravine before making the charge, Ã¢ÂÂ I asked for<lb/>General Ledlie, to whom I was to report, and who was in<lb/>command of the division. He was asleep on the ground.<lb/>His adjutant-general went up and kicked him awake,<lb/>poked him, and said, "Colonel Weld wishes to report."<lb/>I said, "General, we have been driven back and our men<lb/>are all scattered, and I don't know what to do." He drew<lb/>himself up in a hazey-dazey sort of way, and said, "Why<lb/>Colonel Weld, there are thousands of men all around<lb/>here"; and then tumbled down in a drunken sleep again.<lb/>If I had been older and had more sense, I should have<lb/>preferred charges against him.

The cause of the<lb/>whole trouble, in my opinion, is owing to the carelessness<lb/>of those high in command, such as corps commanders<lb/>and higher officers still, who have time and again reck-<lb/>lessly and wickedly placed us in slaughter-pens. I can<lb/>tell you. Father, it is discouraging to see one's men and<lb/>officers cut down and butchered time and again, and all<lb/>for nothing.</p><p>I don't wish you to think from all this that I am croak-<lb/>ing. I feel that we shall take Richmond in time, but hope<lb/>that some consideration and some regard for life will be<lb/>shown in doing so. We can't afford to make many more<lb/>such bloody attacks as we have been doing. The enemy<lb/>will outnumber us if we do so. We shall have to settle<lb/>down to a siege of Petersburg and take the place in that<lb/>way. We have our lines so near the city that it will not<lb/>be a difficult matter to burn and shell the whole concern<lb/>out, if necessary.</p><p>I have 1 80 men left for duty in my regiment, and this<lb/>is a fair-sized regiment.</p><p>We are quite fortunate in our position here.

A traverse runs at<lb/>right angles with the rifle-pit from the "Interior slope,"<lb/>and protects the men from a flank fire. They are usually<lb/>made of logs and dirt thrown up so as to form an embank-<lb/>ment. A traverse naturally divides the rifle-pits Into<lb/>different sections, and In order to connect these differ-<lb/>ent sections I have had a deep and narrow ditch dug<lb/>parallel with the rifle-plt. From each section another nar-<lb/>row ditch runs out and connects with the one parallel to<lb/>the pit. The men can now travel round In comparative<lb/>safety. Before I came here, It was very dangerous Indeed<lb/>to go from one section to another.</p><p>It Is pretty well decided, I think, that anything that Is<lb/>done here In front of Petersburg, will have to be done by<lb/>our corps. We are nearer the enemy's works than any<lb/>other corps except the Eighteenth, and they cannot ad-<lb/>vance any nearer the city, as the position In their front Is<lb/>commanded by the enemy's batteries on the other side<lb/>of the Appomattox. In front of our division we can cer-<lb/>tainly do nothing. If we attempt to charge, we shall be<lb/>cut to pieces. Our only hope lies In General Potter's<lb/>front.

Vols.,<lb/>Near Petersburg, July 8, 1864.</p><p>Dear Hannah, Ã¢ÂÂ ... You ask me what rifle-pits<lb/>are. A rifle-pit proper is a small hole dug for sharp-<lb/>shooters or pickets. It is detached and separate from any<lb/>other pit, and holds from one to three men. The term<lb/>is commonly used, however, as synonymous with breast-<lb/>works. I give you a profile view of one properly con-<lb/>structed. When the men fire, they stand on the place<lb/>marked "3 feet." That is called the "banquette."<lb/>When they are not in action, they go down 2 feet lower,<lb/>and are pretty well protected. When we are at all ex-<lb/>posed to a flank fire, traverses are built. They are mounds<lb/>of earth running at right angles with the main rifle-pit.<lb/>They have to be built quite high and thick in order to<lb/>resist artillery. Where I was the last time I was at the<lb/>front, we would have to trust to our legs and a kind<lb/>Providence to protect us whenever we went anywhere<lb/>from the pits. The enemy would shoot at us regularly.<lb/>In most cases narrow ditches are dug, with the earth<lb/>from the ditch thrown up towards the enemy, leading to<lb/>the rear. The men can walk in these ditches with com-<lb/>parative safety.</p><p>Yesterday as our regiment was moved to the second<lb/>line, I went out on a travelling expedition. I called on<lb/>General Barlow first. He had just received the notice of</p><p>'s dismissal from the service. It seems he asked the</p><p>hospital steward to give him something to make him sick.<lb/>It is too bad, especially as his brothers have done well.</p><p/>

Here I in-<lb/>dulged in a glass of iced milk, which was a great luxury,<lb/>I can assure you. As we approached the James River, we<lb/>had a most beautiful view of the banks on both sides. The<lb/>valley of the James is probably the most fertile portion<lb/>of Virginia. On the opposite side of the James we could<lb/>see enormous fields of wheat already ripe and ready to be<lb/>gathered. In fact, all the land that is under cultivation<lb/>is planted with wheat or corn. On the other bank, I could<lb/>see Aiken's house and Landing. I recognized it immedi-<lb/>ately, it being the place where I was exchanged almost<lb/>two years ago. From Jones's wharf, we went on board a<lb/>tugboat, and steamed up to the Mackinaw, a gunboat<lb/>commanded by Captain Beaumont, formerly in com-<lb/>mand of the Nantucket. When I was introduced, he asked<lb/>me immediately if I was any relation to Dr. Weld, and<lb/>wished to be remembered to him. The tugboat that we<lb/>went out on is called the Linda. There are four of them,<lb/>called torpedo boats. They have a long pole lashed to<lb/>their bow on which a torpedo with 150 lbs. of powder<lb/>can be placed. As soon as the enemy's ironclads make<lb/>their appearance, these four tugs fix their torpedoes on<lb/>and bunt into her. The gunboat Mackinaw was lying<lb/>right off Aiken's Landing.

We<lb/>charged, having to go by the flank, as we could only get<lb/>over in one or two places, and entered the enemy's pits<lb/>under a moderately heavy fire. We found an immense<lb/>hole here, formed by the explosion, some 30 feet deep by<lb/>100 long and 40 wide. We were ordered to go to the right<lb/>of the crater, and here I endeavored to re-form my regi-<lb/>ments. The scene inside was horrible. Men were found<lb/>half buried; some dead, some alive, some with their<lb/>legs kicking in the air, some with the arms only exposed,<lb/>and some with every bone in their bodies apparently<lb/>broken. We held the enemy's line about three or four<lb/>hours, capturing some 500 prisoners. When we had been<lb/>there about four hours, the negro troops charged over,<lb/>filling our pits and crowding us so that our men could not<lb/>use their muskets.

They<lb/>were not to blame for this, as the orders were, when we<lb/>were in the rifle-pits, invariably to duck if they saw a puff<lb/>of smoke from the other side. This was absolutely neces-<lb/>sary, as we lost men every day from their curiosity in<lb/>peeking up to see what was going on. The minute a cap<lb/>appeared it was the target for a dozen sharpshooters. Of<lb/>course we were all nervous, standing there waiting for a<lb/>charge which we were very uncomfortable about, owing<lb/>to reasons which I have explained later on, and the men<lb/>kept ducking as a bullet passed by. I said, ''Steady, men,<lb/>that bullet has gone by you by the time you hear it."<lb/>Just then a bullet, which I am convinced was specially<lb/>meant "for me, went whizzing by me and I at once ducked.<lb/>Every one laughed and I did not blame them, but a more<lb/>mortified man than I was never lived.</p><p>When the mine did go up, it looked as if this immense<lb/>cloud of timber, dirt and stones and everything was go-<lb/>ing to fall right down on us and we involuntarily shrank<lb/>back. We at once got over this and started to make the<lb/>charge. When we got to the pits, as I have said, there was<lb/>no getting over except by a flank. Instead of going over<lb/>about in line of battle, we moved by the flank through<lb/>this narrow space, and before I could get over, the firing</p><p/>

The neglect<lb/>to fix the works in our front also had another very bad<lb/>effect. It broke the regiments all up. The men went over<lb/>by the flank, scattered along as they could get through,<lb/>and with almost no organization. As soon as we got into<lb/>the crater, I did all I could to get my men together, and<lb/>in some sort of shape for a fight. By that time it was al-<lb/>most impossible to do anything. We were as badly off then<lb/>as we were in our own pits. There was no head. Our di-<lb/>vision commander was off on the other side and did not<lb/>come over with us. General Bartlett was a cripple and<lb/>had his wooden leg broken, and it was almost impossible<lb/>to get anything done. I came near having my head<lb/>knocked off by grape-shot two or three times. Finally<lb/>the rebels charged on both our flanks. I was packed in<lb/>there in the midst of the negroes. It was a perfect pan-<lb/>demonium. The negroes charged into the mine, and<lb/>we were packed in there like sardines in a box. I literally<lb/>could not raise my arms from my side. Finally, when the<lb/>Confederates charged, those of the men nearest the rifle-<lb/>pits next our line got over the line and got away. Luckily<lb/>most of my men I had formed there, so that they were<lb/>able to get away and protect our colors.</p><p>I got cut off and took refuge in a bomb-proof, as I could<lb/>not run away, being surrounded on all sides. Pretty<lb/>soon the rebels yelled, "Come out of there, you Yanks."<lb/>I walked out, and the negro who had gone in there with<lb/>me, and Captain Fay came out also. The negro was<lb/>touching my side. The rebels were about eight feet from<lb/>me. They yelled out, "Shoot the nigger, but don't kill the<lb/>white man"; and the negro was promptly shot down by<lb/>my side. They then grabbed my sword and my hat.<lb/>"Come out of that hat, you Yank!" they yelled; and one</p><p/>

One of our officers conversed with<lb/>the captain who took him. It appears he and some few<lb/>men were so run over and trampled upon by the colored<lb/>troops in their stampede that they could n't move until<lb/>too late. It was in between two traverses of the rebel<lb/>first line. The rebel captain says that Steve and the few<lb/>men with him held out to the last, and was finally " taken<lb/>like a soldier with his arms in his hands," by an over-<lb/>whelming rush of rebs. He was unhurt, and took it good-<lb/>naturedly. His enemies could n't help admiring him. I<lb/>send you a lot of letters which have come for Steve, and<lb/>have taken care of his things. I will take measures to send<lb/>home his horses as soon as possible.</p><p>With regards to all your family,</p><p>I am yours truly,</p><p>H. D. Jarves.</p><p>Sunday, July 31.

All along the road we saw traces of Wilson's raid.<lb/>At Burkesville Junction we were delayed until late in<lb/>the evening, on account of a train having been thrown<lb/>off the track.</p><p>Tuesday, August 2. Ã¢ÂÂ Reached Danville at about<lb/>6 A.M., it being distant about one hundred and forty-<lb/>eight miles from Petersburg. We were placed in tobacco<lb/>warehouses, which constitute here, as in every other<lb/>place, the military prisons. We have very poor quarters<lb/>and rations, being thrust into a lousy, dirty room, badly<lb/>ventilated, and with no conveniences for washing, etc.<lb/>Passed a very unpleasant day.</p><p>Wednesday, August 3.

We were to meet<lb/>the train from the South at a turn-out some miles ahead,<lb/>and taking everything into consideration, we had about<lb/>as lively, exciting and unpleasant a ride as I ever hope<lb/>to indulge in. The train went faster than I have ever been<lb/>before, so much so that the cars would actually jump from<lb/>the rail, and yawn and open everywhere. Our destina-<lb/>tion on this heat was Charlotte, one hundred and ten<lb/>miles.</p><p>Friday, August 5. Ã¢ÂÂ Reached Charlotte early in the<lb/>morning, where we drew one day's rations. I got hold<lb/>of a raw onion here, and had a good meal on that, a<lb/>hard-tack, and some wormy bacon. It tasted good, for<lb/>I was hungry. Started again for Columbia, one hundred<lb/>miles distant. We passed through sorghum, cotton and<lb/>corn-fields, Ã¢ÂÂ many of the latter, few of the two former.<lb/>Reached Columbia at 7 p.m., and were immediately sur-<lb/>rounded by friends of the South Carolina regiment that<lb/>was blown up in the mine, anxious to learn about their<lb/>friends and relatives. Were marched to the jail, and from<lb/>what I could see of the town should think it a very pretty<lb/>one. Passed Wade Hampton's house. There were beau-<lb/>tiful shade trees planted along the street we were marched<lb/>through. Was quartered on the lower floor in a room with<lb/>several others.</p><p>Saturday, August 6.

In the lock-up yard are various pigeon-houses<lb/>inhabited by every variety of doves. We spend much of<lb/>our time watching them. Just beyond the yard of the<lb/>lock-up is the court house and town hall, and under them<lb/>the market. We get nearly all our food from there by<lb/>purchases made through the sergeants.

We are to guard this railroad per-<lb/>manently from Petersburg to Burkesville, so I understand.<lb/>My regiment was in the battle on Sunday at Petersburg<lb/>and charged the works. They were very fortunate, only<lb/>losing 14 men killed and wounded. They did splendidly.<lb/>I did not start from Washington until Sunday and reached<lb/>my regiment on Tuesday morning. Met with a very<lb/>gratifying reception indeed. Saw several of General<lb/>Meade's staff. General Lee and remnants of his army<lb/>are supposed to be between the Appomattox and the<lb/>James River on their way to Lynchburg. General Grant<lb/>has his headquarters at Burkesville, about 20 miles from<lb/>here, and General Meade is some 15 miles to the north<lb/>of B. The opinion seems to be that General Lee will be<lb/>cut off, but I doubt it.</p><p>Am perfectly well.</p><p>Am sorry to say that I find my blue mare is dead.<lb/>After Colonel Jarves left, she was ridden by every one,<lb/>contrary to his express orders, and was used up. I feel<lb/>quite badly at losing her. . . .</p><p>Burkesville, Va., April 18, 1865.</p><p>Dear Hannah, Ã¢ÂÂ We are now camped with the bri-<lb/>gade about half a mile from the above place. I have got<lb/>a tent up, and am quite comfortable. My Q. M., who is</p><p>a and is only acting as Q. M., furnishes me daily</p><p>with chickens, ducks, geese, eggs and butter. He wishes<lb/>to be appointed Q. M., but I don't think I shall give it to<lb/>him until he has found all the poultry in the country.</p><p>I went to corps headquarters last evening, which<lb/>are close by us, and saw several of the staff.

To<lb/>tell the truth, we none of us realize even yet that he has<lb/>actually surrendered. I had a sort of impression that we<lb/>should fight him all our lives. He was like a ghost to<lb/>children, something that haunted us so long that we could<lb/>not realize that he and his army were really out of exist-<lb/>ence to us. It will take me some months to be conscious<lb/>of this fact.</p><p>In regard to the brevity of my epistle, I can only say<lb/>that I have nothing to tell about.</p><p/>

While<lb/>there we were given several hundred prisoners to guard.<lb/>Late in the afternoon we heard news of Lee's surrender.<lb/>The Confederates who were prisoners refused to believe<lb/>it. One officer, a lieutenant colonel, made quite a flowery<lb/>speech to me. He said, "Sooner shall the sun cease to<lb/>bury herself in the Occident than Robert E. Lee surren-<lb/>der." Many of them however said they were glad of it,<lb/>and that they were going to make the best of it.</p><p>We marched back to City Point by easy stages, and<lb/>from there were sent by transports to Alexandria, Vir-<lb/>ginia, where we remained until we came home, some time<lb/>in the end of June or beginning of July. Our life there<lb/>was a quiet and pleasant one, though made somewhat<lb/>uneasy by the fact that the men were expecting to be dis-<lb/>charged and did not see the necessity of much discipline.<lb/>While we were waiting there, the grand review was held<lb/>in Washington. I remember we were marched over and<lb/>camped for the night near the Capitol, and then marched<lb/>up Pennsylvania Avenue and by the Treasury Building.<lb/>My men appeared very well.

			<p>CHAPTER IX</p><p>MY LIFE SINCE THE WAR</p><p>When I finally returned home after the War, I found<lb/>that my father had bought stock in a small silk mill in<lb/>Roxbury, called the Boston Silk and Woolen Company,<lb/>and also in a felting mill at Norfolk, Massachusetts,<lb/>called the Elliott Felting Mills. He said that he had<lb/>taken this stock in order to have a place for me when I<lb/>returned, and although I did not at all fancy the job, Ã¢ÂÂ<lb/>for I thought it very doubtful if it could be made a suc-<lb/>cess, Ã¢ÂÂ I took hold and did the best I could.</p><p>The Silk and Woolen mill my father finally sold out<lb/>at quite a loss. The felting mills failed after my fa-<lb/>ther's death, which occurred in December, 1867, and the<lb/>mortification was almost more than I could bear. The<lb/>whole of my share of my father's estate was about four-<lb/>teen thousand dollars' worth of the stock of this felting<lb/>mill. Some good friends, among them Mr. Nathaniel<lb/>Thayer, whose father had been exceedingly kind to my<lb/>father, and the Hon. T. Jefiferson Coolidge, who has al-<lb/>ways been a most liberal and loving friend to me, took<lb/>hold and advised me to buy a cotton mill which was con-<lb/>nected with the felting mill. I bought it for, I think,<lb/>twenty-five thousand dollars, borrowed from my friends,<lb/>and went to live at the City Mill, Norfolk, leaving my<lb/>wife and children with her mother. I literally had not a<lb/>cent left in the world.</p><p>After the mill had been running about a month, a<lb/>freshet broke down the dam of the pond, two miles above</p><p/>

About a quarter<lb/>of a mile away, where the old New York and New Haven<lb/>R. R. (or New York and Erie, as it was then called) ran<lb/>across the valley on a high embankment, the water had<lb/>made up behind this embankment. On going up there<lb/>that evening, I saw and heard the stones shooting out<lb/>from underneath the culvert, which was the ordinary<lb/>channel of the brook, in such a way that it was evident<lb/>to me that the embankment must soon give way. I sent<lb/>a man on horseback to signal the station above to stop<lb/>the New York express, which was due in an hour or two,<lb/>and then turned my attention to the mill, and tried to<lb/>have a channel dug to let the water through when the<lb/>embankment gave way.</p><p>It was all in vain. The whole embankment washed out,<lb/>and down came the flood and swept the mill away Ã¢ÂÂ<lb/>absolutely destroyed it.</p><p>I do not think that any physical misfortune that ever<lb/>happened to me, affected and unmanned me as that did.<lb/>But it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. I went to<lb/>work at once to see what I could do to earn a living, and<lb/>to try to pay off my debts Ã¢ÂÂ the money borrowed to buy<lb/>this mill.</p><p>Mr. George Dexter sent for me and said that he wanted<lb/>a salesman to sell cotton which his brother-in-law, Mr.<lb/>Blagden, bought in New York and sold to the mills. I<lb/>started with them, and in about a year Mr. Dexter re-<lb/>tired, and I went into partnership with Mr. George Blag-<lb/>den, a most charming and delightful man, and a liberal<lb/>and good friend.

We did not make a success of it owing<lb/>to the very large and powerful vested interests in the old-<lb/>fashioned square compress, which we found it impossible<lb/>to compete with. This loss I made up largely from the<lb/>various branch houses established all over the world in<lb/>my endeavors to make the Planters' bale a success.</p><p>I suffered also another large loss of some two hundred<lb/>and twenty-four thousand dollars on forged bills of lad-<lb/>ing of Steele, Miller &amp; Company.

He called out, "If you won't shoot any<lb/>more, I will give up."</p><p>I stopped then, just at the corner of Lauder Street and<lb/>High Street, about two or three hundred yards from the<lb/>house. He stood facing me, with the stone that he had<lb/>not thrown in his hand raised up ready to throw. I had<lb/>the pistol pointing right at him. I said, "If you throw<lb/>that stone, you are a dead man." By that time Barney<lb/>came up. I said, "Barney, grab that fellow by his shirt<lb/>collar, not by his coat collar Ã¢ÂÂ he will slip out of that.<lb/>If he tries to hurt you, I will shoot him." Barney grabbed<lb/>him and they had a tussle, and Barney threw him. Just<lb/>then a police officer came up, having heard the shooting<lb/>from where he was in the village. I told him the circum-<lb/>stances of the case and said that he would probably find<lb/>another man before long who had run into the woods. He<lb/>took the man down to the lock-up, and about an hour<lb/>afterwards a man came along asking the way to Boston.<lb/>They took him to the lock-up. They found on both of<lb/>the men a pair of lady's slippers with a very peculiar ro-<lb/>sette on them, which had undoubtedly been stolen from<lb/>a shoe store. The man who ran to the woods had a pistol,<lb/>and they both had hammers and jimmys in their pockets,<lb/>and great big bags for storing things away in. The men<lb/>were held in jail for four or five months and then brought<lb/>before the Grand Jury, but no bill was found against<lb/>them.</p><p/>

				410 War Diary And Letters Of
			</fw>
			<p>410 WAR DIARY AND LETTERS OF</p><p>The next morning Mrs. Rodman said, "Stephen, I<lb/>heard some one last night swearing, saying, ' I will be<lb/>damned if you don't.' What was it all about?"</p><p>A most curious thing happened to me about 1906<lb/>or 1907. I had bought, at Mrs. Weld's request, a new<lb/>depot omnibus which would carry eight people, to bring<lb/>guests to and from the village and my house. It was<lb/>built by the French Carriage Company of Boston.<lb/>After using it a year between the depot and the house<lb/>only, and once to a neighbor's close by, it began to get a<lb/>little shabby and Mrs. Weld thought it would be well to<lb/>have it varnished. Accordingly it was sent in to the<lb/>French Carriage Company. Mr. French called me up<lb/>in a day or two and asked me if I had lost any jewelry.<lb/>I said no, and finally went down to see him. He said<lb/>something had been found in the omnibus. He told me<lb/>that his workman in taking the body off the wheels had<lb/>to drive a bolt out, and that while driving it a diamond<lb/>bracelet fell down on the handle of his hammer. It<lb/>had dropped through the drip-hole at the bottom of the<lb/>omnibus, which drained the space into which the windows<lb/>dropped down when they were open. I advertised the<lb/>bracelet everywhere and wrote every lady who had ever<lb/>ridden in the carriage, but never could find the owner.<lb/>It was a bracelet worth three thousand dollars. I showed<lb/>it to several jewellers and they could find no jeweller's<lb/>mark on it and nothing to identify it in any way. The<lb/>workman kept the bracelet and probably has it to-day if<lb/>he has not sold it. My theory is that some thief with the<lb/>bracelet was passing by French's shop in front of which<lb/>the wagon was standing, thought he was being followed,<lb/>and got frightened and dropped the bracelet into the en-<lb/>closure on the side of the carriage where the window<lb/>went down. That is the only way I can account for it.</p><p/>

			<p>STEPHEN M. WELD 411</p><p>On June i, 1869, I married Miss Eloise Rodman,<lb/>daughter of Alfred Rodman, Esq., and Anna Lothrop<lb/>Motley, and niece of John Lothrop Motley, the historian.<lb/>We were married in the old Rodman house in Dedham,<lb/>called Tiota Woods Ã¢ÂÂ the same house, by the way, to<lb/>which I came over from Readville, while recruiting my<lb/>regiment there, and brought my regimental band to<lb/>serenade Miss Elizabeth Perry just before her marriage<lb/>to Mr. E. F. Bowditch.</p><p>We had seven children: Ã¢ÂÂ Stephen Minot and Alfred<lb/>Rodman, twins, born September 2, 1870; Edward Mot-<lb/>ley, born September 4, 1872; Lothrop Motley, born July<lb/>26, 1874; Eloise Rodman, born January 24, 1879; Ru-<lb/>dolph, born August 22, 1883; Philip Balch, born January<lb/>4, 1887.</p><p>Only Edward, Rudolph and Philip are now living.</p><p>My first wife died January 14, 1898, and on May 26,<lb/>1904, I married Susan Edith Waterbury, daughter of the<lb/>Rev. Julius H. Waterbury and Jane Rebecca Branford.</p><p/>
