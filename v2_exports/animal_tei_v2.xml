CHAPTER I.
</p>

<p>
ANIAIAL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION.
</p>

<p>
A KNOWLEDGE of the Structure of the various parts of the body<lb/>
{aiiato7ny) and the functions they performi {physiology)^ provides a<lb/>
rational foundation on which to base our acquaintance with animals,<lb/>
their requirements and capabilities ; and so that all may get a clear idea<lb/>
of these complex and technical subjects, necessary references to them<lb/>
are given in as simple language as possible.
</p>

<p>
Cells. â All animal bodies are composed of cells. A cell is a minute Cells,<lb/>
round mass of living matter, which may or may not possess the property of<lb/>
moving itself. Though at first all cells appear alike, they soon become<lb/>
specialised to perform one particular duty, e.g.^ the liver cell makes bile ;<lb/>
the muscle cell acquires the power of contraction. As they increase in<lb/>
number, the pressure of surrounding cells causes them to alter in shape<lb/>
and they may become many sided, flat or spindle-shaped. The entire<lb/>
animal is made up of such minute, specialised bodies, a single cell<lb/>
bearing the same relation to the whole body that a brick does to<lb/>
London. Cells multiply by dividing, each portion attaining to the size<lb/>
of its parent. This power is most marked in youth, growth^ and<lb/>
declines in age, decay.
</p>

<p>
Bones. â The framework of the body is constructed of bones^ so Bones,<lb/>
arranged that they can be used as rigid supports, or become freely<lb/>
movable when the joints are brought into play. A joint is formed joints,<lb/>
wherever two bones meet and move over each other ; it is always<lb/>
surrounded by an air-tight capsule, and in order to prevent any friction,<lb/>
the ends of the bones are covered by thick layers of gristle {cartilage\<lb/>
which have extremely smooth surfaces. Inside the joint are found special<lb/>
fringes which lie loosely in the capsule and produce "joint oil " {synovia), a<lb/>
peculiarly oily, slippery fluid, which bathes the entire joint and ensures<lb/>
the most perfect lubrication. The movement of joints is accompHshed<lb/>
by the action of muscles.
</p>

<p>
Muscles are the red butcher's meat which we eat, constitute a great Muscles,<lb/>
part of the body, and are attached to the bones in such fashion as to
</p>

enable them to move the joints to the greatest advantage when they<lb/>
contract. The power of contraction is the distinguishing feature of<lb/>
muscles : when called into action tKey shorten and thicken themselves,<lb/>
drawing their points of attachment closer together and so bending the<lb/>
joints.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the red muscles {voluntary) with which we are all<lb/>
familiar, and which we move at will, there is another set not under the<lb/>
control of the will {involuntary), which is met with throughout the<lb/>
internal organs, and to which, in particular, the bowels owe their<lb/>
remarkable power of movement. These involuntary muscles, except the<lb/>
heart, are pale in colour and distributed in thin layers instead of thick<lb/>
bunches ; but they are as powerful and capable of even more<lb/>
sustained exertion than the voluntary ones. In speaking of muscles<lb/>
generally, it is the red, voluntary ones which are alluded to, but the<lb/>
existence of the others should not be forgotten.
</p>

<p>
Te/idons. â Muscles, though very elastic and capable of exerting great<lb/>
force, are quite soft and easily torn ; they would be incapable of<lb/>
withstanding the strains to which they are constantly subjected if they<lb/>
were not provided with tendons. A tendon is a tough, inelastic rope,<lb/>
composed of firm, parallel threads, running throughout its length, one<lb/>
end being securely attached to a bone, whilst the other is spliced into<lb/>
the substance of a muscle. Through the medium of this rigid attachment<lb/>
the muscle exerts the full force of its elasticity without fear of injury and,<lb/>
as a matter of fact, when sprains of these structures do occur, it is<lb/>
usually the tendon which gives way.
</p>

<p>
Ligaments are similar in structure to tendons, but differ in their<lb/>
attachment ; they run from bone to bone in the neighbourhood of joints,<lb/>
and are not attached to muscles. They serve to prevent over-extension<lb/>
of joints, and while permitting free movement, knit the component bones<lb/>
firmly together.
</p>

<p>
The Nervous System. â The whole of the above organs of locomotion<lb/>
are set in action and controlled by the will power, which originates in the<lb/>
brain and is transmitted by means of the spinal cord and nerves. The<lb/>
Nervous inechanism maybe aptly compared to a very complete telephonic<lb/>
system which, radiating from the central exchange, the brain, takes orders<lb/>
and conveys messages to and from the entire body. Nerves may be<lb/>
divided into two groups, those which gives rise to feeling {sensory), and<lb/>
those connected with motion {?/iotor).<lb/>
The spinal The Spinal Cordis the continuation of the brain down the back-bone,<lb/>
cord. from which many nerves arise, and which acts the part of sub-office to
</p>

the brain.

ANIMAL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION. 7
</p>

<p>
Fat is stored in various situations to form cushions, to round off Fat.<lb/>
corners, and to serve as a reserve of food if required.
</p>

<p>
Noicrishmeilt is brought to the whole of these structures by the blood Use of<lb/>
constantly circulating through the blood-vessels^ which are of three Blood;<lb/>
varieties, arteries^ veins^ and capillaries.
</p>

<p>
Arteries are muscular, thick-walled elastic tubes which, springing Arteries,<lb/>
from the heart, ramify through the entire body. Gradually diminishing in<lb/>
calibre as their length increases, they reach and supply every organ and<lb/>
structure, finally becoming merged in the capillaries.
</p>

<p>
Capillaries are, as their name denotes, the finest, thinnest, hair-like Capil-<lb/>
tubes imaginable. They permeate every nook and cranny of the system, laries.<lb/>
so that the merest pin prick will draw blood, z&amp;gt;., wound several of them.
</p>

<p>
Veitis are the continuation of the capillaries on the return journey Veins,<lb/>
towards the heart, approaching which they increase in size, receiving fresh<lb/>
tributaries from all parts, till they empty themselves into that organ.<lb/>
Here and there in the course of a vein, slight enlargement of its calibre<lb/>
may be noticed, due to the presence of valves which prevent the blood<lb/>
flowing backwards. A valve consists of two or three little skin-like<lb/>
pouches with their openings towards the heart ; so long as the blood<lb/>
flows in that direction they lie flat against the side of the vessel and do<lb/>
not obstruct it, but if there is any back wash it automatically fills them,<lb/>
causing them to bulge into the vein and completely block it. Their<lb/>
action may be well observed by pressing the blood to and fro in the veins<lb/>
on the back of one's own hands. Veins are thinner and are less elastic<lb/>
than arteries, but are capable of containing more blood when distended.
</p>

<p>
The Blood consists of a straw-coloured fluid, in which an infinite The blood,<lb/>
number of minute bodies {corpuscles) are suspended. During life and<lb/>
when freshly drawn from the body, blood is quite fluid, but rapidly<lb/>
solidifies {clots) on exposure to the air. The blood co7piiscles are of two<lb/>
varieties, red and white. Red corpuscles are very numerous, give the<lb/>
blood its colour, are shaped like a quoit with a solid centre, and measure<lb/>
about 3^ of an inch in diameter. Their peculiar power of absorbing<lb/>
oxygen makes them important factors in questions of ventilation and<lb/>
breathing. White corpuscles are comparatively few in numbers as<lb/>
compared with the red variety, are larger, have the power of moving,<lb/>
and are engaged in the duty of attacking and destroying any harmful<lb/>
germs which attempt to invade the body.
</p>

<p>
The Heart is a hollow, cone-shaped organ, composed entirely of The heart,<lb/>
muscle. It is situated in the centre of the chest with its point directed<lb/>
downwards and slightly inclined to the left. Internally it is divided into<lb/>
four compartments, those on the left side being thicker walled and

stronger than those on the right. The npper chambers are called<lb/>
auricles from their resemblance to the human ear, while the lower, which<lb/>
constitute the bulk of the organ, are termed ventricles. At the top of<lb/>
each auricle is the entrance of the large veins of the body and lungs, while<lb/>
below they communicate with their respective ventricles. From the right

the blood from the large arteries. The ftmction of the heart is to keep<lb/>
up the circulation of the blood ; it begins to work before birth, does not<lb/>
cease till after death, and in the meantime acts as a perfect, self-regulating<lb/>
automatic pump. The circulation of the blood follows the course shown<lb/>
in the accompanying diagram.
</p>

<p>
Starting from the left auricle the blood flows down into the left<lb/>
ventricle ; as it fills, the valves guarding the opening float up on the<lb/>
surface of the blood, till, when they are horizontal, the meeting of their<lb/>
edges closes it. At this moment the heart " contracts."
</p>

<p>
This contraction is familiar to all as the " beating " of the heart ; it<lb/>
violently shortens itself, screws itself slightly round, squeezes all its<lb/>
chambers empty and produces a "lubb-dup" sound at each beat, then<lb/>
relaxes, fills again, and repeats the process. The sounds maybe distinctly<lb/>
heard and the " beat " felt by applying the ear to the chest wall. By the<lb/>
contraction the blood in the left ventricle is forced into the main artery<lb/>
of the body {the aorta).
</p>

<p>
This large vessel immediately divides, one branch going to the head,<lb/>
neck and fore limbs ; the other, the larger of the two, running along the<lb/>
under surface of the backbone and supplying the liver, stomach, bowels,<lb/>
and hind quarters. The finest arteries merge into the capillaries which<lb/>
form a close-meshed network through every part of the body, and it is<lb/>
during this capillary circulation that nourishment slips from the blood to<lb/>
the various structures. Passing successively from the capillaries to the<lb/>
small and the large veins, the blood reaches the right auricle, being<lb/>
reinforced during its passage by the nourishment which has been derived<lb/>
from the food as the result of digestion ; it then passes into the right<lb/>
ventricle, from which it is expelled to the lungs. Here it is brought into<lb/>
contact with the air, after admixture with which it is returned to the left<lb/>
auricle again (see also Respiration, p. lo).
</p>

<p>
The Lymphatic System. â This is another extensive and important The<lb/>
system of vessels, as widely distributed as the blood-vessels, but not lymphatic<lb/>
nearly so prominent. Its largest vessel flows into the blood stream system,<lb/>
near the heart, and to it the whole of the body's lymphatics contribute.<lb/>
Lymphatics are very thin-walled vessels, and as the lymph they contain is<lb/>
colourless, they are not as a rule apparent to the eye. Their functions<lb/>
are to collect from the bowels the goodness which is digested from the<lb/>
food, and to prevent the accumulation of fluid in any part of the body.<lb/>
The fluid which is thus collected is prepared and filtered by the lymph<lb/>
glands, and ultimately poured into the large veins on the right side of the<lb/>
heart, by the vessel alluded to above. Lymphatics only attract notice<lb/>
as a rule when something goes wrong with them, when they are often

prominent, standing out like veins on the skin, while pain and swelling<lb/>
of the limbs and nearest glands is frequently observed. The glands<lb/>
under the jaw, beneath the arm, and inside the thigh, are those most<lb/>
frequently observed to be so affected.
</p>

<p>
The body, excluding the limbs, is divided into two great cavities â the<lb/>
chest, and the belly.
</p>

<p>
The Chest contains the heart, the great blood-vessels and the lungs ;<lb/>
while a portion of the gullet passes through it en route to the stomach.<lb/>
Its length extends from the point of the breast-bone to the midriff<lb/>
(diaphragm), while on each side the ribs form a strong, sufficiently<lb/>
elastic cage to protect the organs it contains, and permit their free<lb/>
movements during respiration.
</p>

<p>
The first eight ribs are firmly jointed to the breast-bone, and this<lb/>
makes a rigid protection for the heart, which is situated between them ;<lb/>
while the remainder are attached less firmly to each other, and allow<lb/>
greater freedom of movement. The space between the first ribs may be<lb/>
termed the entrance to the chest, and through this the windpipe<lb/>
(trachea), and gullet (oesophagus) make their entry.
</p>

<p>
Respiration i^Breathijig). â Air is drawn through the nostrils or<lb/>
mouth (in the horse through the nostrils only), passes through the<lb/>
larynx (organ or voice), down the wind-pipe, and enters the<lb/>
lungs. In the lungs the air and blood mix, and exchange the elements<lb/>
they require ; the used, polluted air is then expelled, a slight pause<lb/>
ensues, and the process repeats itself.
</p>

<p>
The Nostrils differ in shape according to the animal's requirements,<lb/>
those of the galloping horse being thin, widely open, and capable of<lb/>
still wider distension, if necessary, to increase the air supply, while oxen<lb/>
and camels not being required to go such a pace, are provided<lb/>
respectively with a rigid, thick-edged opening, and a pendulous slit.
</p>

<p>
The Larynx^ the organ which produces the voice, is situated in the<lb/>
throat between the branches of the lower jaw, where it may be readily<lb/>
felt. Its body is made of cartilages, which are jointed together so that<lb/>
the surrounding muscles can narrow or widen its calibre. Food and<lb/>
water pass over its opening on their way down the gullet, and in order to<lb/>
prevent their entrance a lid is provided which closes automatically, and<lb/>
with water-tight accuracy, whenever the animal swallows. Coughing and<lb/>
difficulty in swallowing are immediately experienced if there is anything<lb/>
the matter with the opening (the glottis), or the lid (the epiglottis), e.g.^<lb/>
during a sore throat. Inside are two thick elastic cords, so placed as to<lb/>
form a triangular opening with the floor of the organ ; when the calibre is<lb/>
varied by the action of the muscles, the edges of the cords are rendered

tense or slack, thin or thick according to the strain placed upon them,<lb/>
and as the distance between them is widened or narrowed at the same<lb/>
time, the rush of air through this constantly varying aperture produces<lb/>
the sounds of the voice. If they are stretched to their utmost, and<lb/>
brought close together, a high note results, while relaxation and<lb/>
separation of their edges gives a deep tone.
</p>

<p>
The windpipe extends from the larynx to the lungs ; it runs along the The<lb/>
lower border of the neck, and can be easily felt as far down as the windpipe,<lb/>
entrance to the chest. It is composed of rings of cartilage (gristle),<lb/>
the ends of which overlap each other, and as this arrangement permits it<lb/>
to withstand considerable pressure, it is not often injured. It is lined by<lb/>
microscopic hairs, constantly agitated in an upward direction, by means<lb/>
of which phlegm is brought up from the lungs. At the entrance to the<lb/>
chest the windpipe divides, one branch going to each lung, and from this<lb/>
on, they divide and divide until they become very minute, when they<lb/>
lose their gristly rings, and become thin membranous tubes, which<lb/>
continue to divide in the same fashion. The ultimate divisions expand<lb/>
suddenly into little, mulberry shaped balloons [air vesicles)^ the walls of<lb/>
which are so thin that they allow the gases of the air and blood to pass<lb/>
freely from one to the other.
</p>

<p>
The Limgs {lights) are two large, elastic organs which, except for the The lungs<lb/>
space occupied by the heart, completely fill the chest. They may be (lights),<lb/>
described as equally full of air and blood, the entire space, not<lb/>
occupied by the air vesicles just described, being filled with blood-vessels.
</p>

<p>
The outside of the lungs, and the inside of the chest, is covered by a<lb/>
smooth, shiny, slippery membrane {pleura)^ which prevents friction.
</p>

<p>
The Diaphragm {inidrijf) is a strong, thin curtain of muscle which The dia-<lb/>
separates the chest from the belly ; it is attached to the inner sides of the P^'"^?^<lb/>
ribs, beginning high up under the backbone, just in front of the loins, and (m'&amp;lt;i"")-<lb/>
slopes downwards and forwards to the breastbone. It is pierced by the<lb/>
great blood-vessels, and the gullet as they pass out of the chest ; its<lb/>
front is covered by pleura, and lies in touch with the lungs, whilst the<lb/>
liver and stomach are immediately on its other side.

(inspiration), these expand ; the ribs are drawn outwards to enlarge the<lb/>
chest from side to side, and the diaphragm is drawn back on each side to<lb/>
deepen it. It is evident that this movement of the diaphragm will cause<lb/>
considerable pressure on the liver and stomach, and if the latter is very<lb/>
full of food, the movement will be embarrassed and carried out with<lb/>
difficulty. It is, therefore, easy to understand why a full stomach<lb/>
militates against fast work, which demands rapid, deep, easy respiration,<lb/>
and also why indigestion and colic sometimes follow injudicious feeding<lb/>
during work.
</p>

<p>
The Belly includes the whole of that portion of the body which lies The belly,<lb/>
below the back and between the chest and hind-quarters ; it contains the<lb/>
stomach, bowels, liver and pancreas, i.e.^ the organs of digestion, and also<lb/>
the spleen or milt, the kidneys and bladder, and the womb of the female.

mouth, in order to give a concise and easily understood narrative.
</p>

<p>
Food having been taken into the mouth by means of the lips, is rolled<lb/>
about by the tongue, chewed by the molars or grinding teeth, and at the<lb/>
same time is mixed with large quantities of saliva which are poured out<lb/>
from the glands behind and beneath the jaw. The quantity of saliva<lb/>
produced is very great ; in horses or cattle always equal to or greater<lb/>
than the amount of food consumed ; and the resulting pasty mixture<lb/>
is carried to the back of the mouth where it enters the gullet.
</p>

<p>
The 7nolar teeih of the horse are twenty-four in number, six on The molar<lb/>
each side of each jaw (in advance of the first ones tiny, rudi- teeth,<lb/>
mentary, " wolves " teeth m,ay sometimes be observed but are of no<lb/>
importance). They present large roughened wearing surfaces, which,<lb/>
when looked at from the front, slope downwards and outwards, leaving a<lb/>
sharp chisel edge on the outside of the upper and on the inside of the<lb/>
lower teeth. The teeth of the lower jaw are narrower than those in the<lb/>
upper, and as they are moved from side to side during mastication they<lb/>
travel over this wider surface and make very effective grindstones.<lb/>
Whilst this movement is perfect, the teeth maintain their respective<lb/>
contours and are worn evenly down as fast as they grow, but if the<lb/>
lateral movement of the lower jaw is not great enough to cover the<lb/>
entire upper surface, the sharp edges will become unduly prolonged, a Sharp<lb/>
condition which may interfere with mastication and occasionally requires teeth,<lb/>
removal.
</p>

<p>
Having reached the back of the mouth the food is seized by the<lb/>
muscles at the top of the gullet and forced down it towards the stomach.
</p>

<p>
The gullet is situated on the left side of the lower portion of the neck The<lb/>
and reaches from throat to stomach. Its course may be easily traced gullet.

from behind the jaw to its entrance into the chest, by watching a horse<lb/>
swallow a mouthful of hay. At the entrance to the chest it passes<lb/>
through the two first ribs, between the lungs, over the heart, through the<lb/>
midriff Cdiapnragm), and ends at its junction with the stomach, which,<lb/>
except when forced open by the entrance of food, is tightly closed.
</p>

<p>
The sto7nach of the horse, a bag-like organ with two openings, one<lb/>
from the gullet and the other to the bowel, is, for the size of the animal,<lb/>
remarkably small. It has, like all the digestive organs, powerful muscular<lb/>
coats for the purpose of kneading and churning the food, and it<lb/>
manufactures a digestive fluid called "gastric juice" in very large<lb/>
quantities. Here the already chewed, saliva-soaked food is thoroughly<lb/>
mixed with the gastric juice and then passed into the bowel, at which<lb/>
stage it is a thick yellowish cream, wirh finely broken up portions of the<lb/>
more woody fodder floating in it. The bowels (intestines) along which<lb/>
it now passes are divided into small and large. The small bowel is, in<lb/>
the horse, about 70 feet long, and, although freely movable in the belly,<lb/>
is suspended from the underside of the backbone by a thin membrane<lb/>
or caul, which envelopes it, and through which its blood-vessels and nerves<lb/>
run. Its inner coat manufactures a special digestive fluid, and about<lb/>
two feet from the stomach the duct from the fiver and pancreas opens<lb/>
into it.
</p>

<p>
The pancreas (which is one of the organs popularly known as the<lb/>
" sweetbread ") is situated under the loins in front of the kidneys, and<lb/>
pours into the bowel its particular secretion which, together with the bile,<lb/>
mixes constantly with the partially digested food.
</p>

<p>
The liver is a large, flat, roughly square chocolate-coloured organ, two<lb/>
to four inches in thickness and several pounds in weight which lies<lb/>
immediately behind and flat up against the midriff; it is, in fact, squeezed<lb/>
between the latter and the stomach, and from it a small duct passes to<lb/>
the bowel for the passage of bile (gall). The liver secretes bile, which<lb/>
acts as a disinfectant to the bowel ; it also takes a large share in prepar-<lb/>
ing the digested result of the food for use by the muscles, which<lb/>
is its most important duty. During its passage along the small bowel â â¢<lb/>
which, it must be remembered, is in constant active motion, churning and<lb/>
dissolving the food mixture â rapid absorption of the now fluid nourish-<lb/>
ment commences and continues actively throughout its course.
</p>

<p>
From the small bowel the large bowel is reached, and this, about<lb/>
thirty feet long, and of great capacity, occupies the major portion of<lb/>
the belly. At the junction of the large and small bowel is the " water<lb/>
gut" or "blind gut" {cceciun), a cone-shaped bowel capable of containing<lb/>
several gallons, which usually holds a considerable quantity of fluid as

<p>
opposed to the much more solid contents of the rest of the large bowel ;<lb/>
and in addition to taking its part in digestion it appears to be a reservoir<lb/>
where water is stored and from whence it is issued to the body as required.<lb/>
The remaining portion of the large bowel {the colo?i) is doubled twice on<lb/>
itself the entire length of the belly and ends in the rectum. It is in the<lb/>
last part of the colon that the animal's droppings take their characteristic<lb/>
shape before expulsion. The unabsorbed portions of the food pass very<lb/>
slowly along the large bowel, being continually kneaded by the constant<lb/>
worm-like motions of the gut until all the nutriment which the animal is<lb/>
capable of extracting from it has been absorbed.
</p>

<p>
The main actions of the various digestive fluids are as follows : â Actions ot
</p>

<p>
The saliva, by its viscidity and quantity, renders swallowing easy and digestive<lb/>
also helps to convert the starches of the food into sugar, which is a fluids,<lb/>
necessary preliminary to their absorption.
</p>

<p>
The gastric juice, which is acid, converts the flesh-forming (proteid)<lb/>
portions into more easily absorbed substances known as " peptones,"<lb/>
assists in breaking up the fibrous portions and converts starches into<lb/>
sugars.
</p>

<p>
The exact role of the secretions of the bowels themselves are not<lb/>
thoroughly ascertained, but in the large bowel especially the digestion<lb/>
of fibrous materials is mainly carried on.
</p>

<p>
The bile converts fats into an emulsion and acts as a disinfectant of<lb/>
the general contents of the bowels.
</p>

<p>
The pancreatic juice may be termed a general digestive fluid ; it<lb/>
further converts starches into sugar, turns flesh-formers (proteids) into<lb/>
peptones and emulsifies fats.
</p>

<p>
After undergoing these changes a large portion of the nutrim.ent is<lb/>
absorbed, sucked up, by the inner coats of the bowel and poured into<lb/>
the lymphatics of the bowel or the blood-vessels which run from the<lb/>
bowels and stomach to the liver, where, as before mentioned, it is<lb/>
suitably prepared as fuel for the use of the muscles and either issued<lb/>
or stored up as required. Owing to this a temporary congestion of the<lb/>
liver occurs after feeding, and if the organ is not assisted in its functions<lb/>
by judicious exercise it is liable to get out of order.
</p>

<p>
In the foregoing account the digestive organs of the horse have been<lb/>
described, but there are some differences between them and the organs<lb/>
of ruminants, e.g., the ox and camel, which require note.
</p>

<p>
The digestive system of riwiinaitts generally is designed to cope with The<lb/>
a rough and bulky class of forage and provides for its mastication twice digestive<lb/>
over. The molar teeth are more jagged to grind coarse food ; the tongue system of<lb/>
is harder, to guard against injury ; and the gullet is more capacious, and ruminants.

admits of easy regurgitation for the purpose of " chewing the cud."<lb/>
While in the horse the stomach is small and the bowels large, the reverse<lb/>
is the case with oxen and camels : the stomach is enormous, and the<lb/>
intestines relatively small. The stomach is divided into four compart-<lb/>
ments : the '''' paunch " (rumen) is the first and largest division : it occupies<lb/>
the greater part of the belly, into which the whole of the food passes when<lb/>
first chewed and is from there returned to the mouth when the animal<lb/>
has leisure to re-masticate it. The second and third divisions, the<lb/>
'"''honeycomb''^ (reticulum), and ^'' j?ui?iyplies" or ^''fardel" (omasum),<lb/>
resemble respectively the pattern of a honeycomb and the leaves of a<lb/>
book, but they are smaller and not so important as the first and last.<lb/>
The fourth compartment, the ^'' reimeV^ (abomasum), is the true digestive<lb/>
stomach which manufactures the gastric juice, and leads into the bowel. In<lb/>
all matters relating to the feeding and working of oxen and camels the<lb/>
necessity of good grazing or an ample supply of bulky forage, and leisure<lb/>
for them to re-chew it (" chew the cud "), must be insisted on if they are<lb/>
to retain working condition. Neglect of this will rapidly render either of<lb/>
these animals useless for military purposes.<lb/>
The spleen The Spleen or Milt is a bluish grey colour, shaped like an isosceles<lb/>
or milt. triangle, under two pounds in weight, and like strawberry jam when cut<lb/>
into. Its full uses do not appear to be yet understood, but it seems under<lb/>
certain conditions to be a reservoir for the blood.<lb/>
The The Kidneys lie on each side of the backbone, under the loins, and
</p>

<p>
kidneys, from them a tube for the passage of urine leads to the bladder.<lb/>
In structure they consist of an enormous number of small tubes, which,<lb/>
starting from little knots of capillary blood-vessels, run at first a contorted,<lb/>
and afterwards a straight course, towards the eye of the kidney, where<lb/>
they empty themselves into the tube leading to the i)ladder. The duty<lb/>
of the kidneys is to filter waste matters from the blood as it circulates<lb/>
through them.<lb/>
The The Bladder is merely a reservoir which allows the urine to
</p>

<p>
bladder. be collected and discharged occasionally instead of dribbling away
</p>

<p>
continuously.<lb/>
The skin. The Skin may be divided into two layers : a deep and sensitive one
</p>

<p>
(the dermis), which contains blood-vessels, nerves, sweat glands, oil glands<lb/>
and hair bulbs or roots ; and a superficial, insensitive layer (scurf skin,<lb/>
epidermis) which is constantly being shed (scurf, dandruff). Through the<lb/>
epidermis the hairs, and tubes of the oil and sweat glands, pass to gain<lb/>
The pores, the surface, where their openings are collectively called " the pores." The<lb/>
sweat glands are coiled tubes lying deep in the skin and gaining the<lb/>
surface by a thin, spiral duct through which the sweat is discharged.

ANIMAL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION. IJ
</p>

<p>
They are constantly in action, and even when the body is at rest there<lb/>
is a very slight perspiration from them, though not sufficient to be visible.<lb/>
The hairs are produced from the hair bulbs, which also are deep in the skin,<lb/>
and they make their exit at such an acute angle with the surface that the<lb/>
coat lies flat and smooth. The coat is shed twice yearly, m spring and<lb/>
autumn, and replaced by a finer or thicker growth suitable to the season,<lb/>
while throughout the year there is a constant slight shedding of old and<lb/>
growth of new hair. Each hair has a muscle, which when in action<lb/>
can pull it into an upright position, and on each side of each hair is<lb/>
attached a small oil gland, the produce of which is exuded at the base of<lb/>
the hair and greases it. The scurf skin (epidermis) acts the part of a<lb/>
protective layer to the too sensitive structures underneath ; the sweat<lb/>
helps to regulate the body temperature and get rid of some of the waste<lb/>
products caused by exertion ; the coat provides warmth, and the oil glands,<lb/>
by greasing the hairs, give them polish and render the whole surface water-<lb/>
proof. The skin generally is very elastic, varies in thickness according to<lb/>
the amount of protection required by the part covered, and, when handled,<lb/>
should feel " loose " and freely movable over the structures beneath.<lb/>
Over the sides of the body it is capable of considerable muscular movement<lb/>
which enables the animal to twitch it violently for the removal of flies.<lb/>
In health the coat should lie flat, feel quite smooth and carry a nice gloss ;<lb/>
want of condition, exposure, privation, neglect, or ill-health may cause it<lb/>
to " stare," that is, stand on end ; look " dull," or feel " harsh '' ; and under<lb/>
similar circumstances the whole skin may lose its usual mobility, and feel<lb/>
as if glued^to the ribs, a condition known as "hidebound."
</p>

<p>
The rouHne of the body. â Having taken a survey of the body com- xhe<lb/>
ponents and their functions, we can now assemble the whole and vie\vthe routine of<lb/>
result of their working as one machine. The routine work of the body is the body,<lb/>
comparable to that of an engine which by the combustion of coal (food)<lb/>
produces heat (work) and ashes (waste).
</p>

<p>
The complex substances eaten as food are broken up by the digestion<lb/>
into simpler materials which can be absorbed by the intestines, and this<lb/>
nourishment finds its way, via the liver and lymphatics, into the blood.<lb/>
By this channel it is carried to the capillary circulation of every organ ;<lb/>
here it slips into the muscles and is converted into " energy," " work."<lb/>
Both these operations, viz., the conversion of food into nourishment, and<lb/>
the using of this to do work, are productive of heat. The heat produced<lb/>
is regulated so that it remains practically constant (the temperature),<lb/>
and in this regulation, the skin (sweating) and the lungs (breathing),<lb/>
assisted by the bowels and kidneys, take the leading parts. With such<lb/>
changes constantly occurring, there must of necessity be considerable<lb/>

waste, and this is excreted by the bowels (faeces), and the kidneys (urine),<lb/>
the skin and lungs also assisting to a considerable extent, while the<lb/>
lymphatics take care that no unnecessary fluids collect in the tissues.
</p>

<p>
In order that these functions may be carried out with as great perfec-<lb/>
tion as possible, the animal should, in all circumstances, be placed under<lb/>
the most suitable conditions, and these are considered in subsequent<lb/>
chapters.

CHAPTER 11.
</p>

<p>
THE POINTS OF THE HORSE, COLOURS, MARKING<lb/>
AND AGE.
</p>

<p>
The '-'â pomts " of the horse are the terms used to indicate the several The<lb/>
regions alluded to. " points'
</p>

<p>
Commencing at the top of the head, the part immediately between of the<lb/>
and behind the ears is called the " poll " ; the " forehead " is from the poll "O'^se.<lb/>
down to the level of the eyes. From the level of the eyes downwards to<lb/>
the nostrils we have the " face," and the lower part, including nostrils,<lb/>
mouth and chin, is generally termed the " muzzle." By taking hold of<lb/>
the inner side of the nostril, one is able to see some distance up it, to note<lb/>
that it rapidly gets very narrow, and to see on the floor of it, rather<lb/>
towards the inner side, a small hole, which looks as if it had been made<lb/>
with a punch. This opening is the end of a small canal which starts<lb/>
from the inner side of the lower eyelid and allows the tears to be got<lb/>
rid of without running over the face.
</p>

<p>
Starting again from the poll : the top of the neck from which the<lb/>
mane springs is called the " crest," and passing the hand down this we<lb/>
come to the " withers." The withers rise slightly from the end of the<lb/>
neck and slope away down to the back ; they are situated immediately<lb/>
over the top of the shoulder blade. Behind the withers lies the " back " ;<lb/>
behind the back the " loins," " croup " and " dock." The " back" runs as<lb/>
far from behind the shoulder blade as a hunting saddle reaches, the<lb/>
" loins " from there to the top of the quarter, and the " croup " from thence<lb/>
on to the root of the tail or " dock." Coming back to the head, the<lb/>
space between the branches of the jaw is called the "jowl," and just<lb/>
behind it is the '* throat." Running down the lower part of each side of<lb/>
the neck, from the angle of the jaw to just in front of the shoulder, is a<lb/>
well-marked shallow groove in which the large blood-vessels of the head<lb/>
and neck lie. On the near side the "gullet" also lies in this groove, and<lb/>
its position may be accurately noted whenever the animal swallows a<lb/>
mouthful of food. Beneath these grooves and in the centre line the

</p>

<p>
"windpipe" is found and may be traced from the throat to the base of<lb/>
the neck where it enters the chest, the rings of cartilage of which it is<lb/>
composed being easily felt beneath the skin.
</p>

<p>
At the lower part of the neck where it joins the body is the "breast,"<lb/>
in the centre of which may be felt the point of the breast-bone. This bone<lb/>
runs backwards between the forelegs and terminates in a broad piece of<lb/>
cartilage with a slightly upward curve which is seen just behind the<lb/>
point of the elbow ; this is the " girth-place."
</p>

<p>
The ribs, eighteen in number, springing from the backbone above and<lb/>
attached to the breast-bone below, form a cage for the organs of the<lb/>
chest and belly which extends from between the front of the shoulders to<lb/>
the loins. They may be felt from behind the shoulder backwards, and<lb/>
the space between the last rib and the hind-quarter is termed the "flank."<lb/>
The regions occupied by the " chest " and " belly" respectively may be<lb/>
estimated by drawing a line, curved forward in its length, from the loins<lb/>
above to the girth-place below. The " forehand " includes head, neck and<lb/>
fore limb. The " quarters '' are the whole of the parts from flank to tail.
</p>

<p>
Turning one's attention now to the foreleg, the " shoulder-blade " slopes<lb/>
downwards and forwards to the "point of the shoulder," where with the<lb/>
"shoulder-bone," or humerus, it forms the shoulder joint ; this latter being<lb/>
continued backwards and downwards to the " elbow-joint." The whole<lb/>
of this region from the top of the shoulder-blade down to the elbow and<lb/>
including the large mass of muscle behind the bones constitutes the<lb/>
"shoulder." The "arm" or "forearm" reaches from the elbow to the<lb/>
knee, the bones being covered with muscles except on the inside, where<lb/>
they lie close under the skin. The bone forming the " point of the elbow "<lb/>
may be felt projecting prominently at the back of the elbow-joint. On<lb/>
the inner side of the arm may be noted a horny prominence, the<lb/>
" chestnut " or " castor."
</p>

<p>
From below the knee to the next joint, the bone running down the front<lb/>
of the leg is termed the "cannon," "shank," or "shin," and the tendons<lb/>
from the bend of the knee down the back of the same area are familiar<lb/>
to all as the " back-tendons." This brings us to the " fetlock" joint, and<lb/>
below this the " pastern " slopes downwards and forwards to the hoof.<lb/>
The region round the top of the hoof is called the " coronet," and<lb/>
usually, there is a slight bulging forward of the skin at this point.
</p>

<p>
Commencing now at the top of the hind-quarter, we find, about a<lb/>
good hand's breadth behind the last rib, a bony prominence just<lb/>
beneath the skin, the " point of the hip " ; the projection of the quarter<lb/>
just below the root of the tail or " dock " is the " point of the quarter "<lb/>
or " buttock," and about midway between the point of the hip and

THE POINTS OF THE HORSE, ETC. 21
</p>

<p>
buttock, lying deeply in the muscles, is the "hip-joint." The hip-bone<lb/>
runs from the hip-joint to the " stifle," which is the large joint found<lb/>
behind the lower pnrt of the flank ; from here the " thigh " runs<lb/>
backwards and downwards to the " hock-joint," and the prominent bunch<lb/>
of muscles found over the outside of the lower part of the thigh is often<lb/>
called the "gaskin" or " second thigh." The " hamstring" is the thick<lb/>
strong tendon running from the muscles at the back of the thigh to the<lb/>
" point of the hock." 13elow the hock the same terms are used as in the<lb/>
foreleg. The "chestnut" in the hind leg is situated on the inner and<lb/>
lower part of the hock.
</p>

<p>
The Points in Detail.
</p>

<p>
The Head ^ovX^ not be large in proportion to the animal's size ; big The head,<lb/>
heads are heavy, and although nature provides a strong support in the<lb/>
neck, still every pound tells when the horse is tired. There should be<lb/>
a general appearance of leanness, with width between the eyes, depth<lb/>
through the jaw and fineness about the muzzle ; the lips closed firmly<lb/>
over the teeth, the nostrils fine at the edges and standing well open, the<lb/>
ears on the alert and carried forward (" pricked "). Breed has a great<lb/>
effect on the head, a high-caste Arab offering perhaps the best type ; but<lb/>
well-bred horses, whether race-horses or cart-horses, generally have good<lb/>
heads of their class.
</p>

<p>
When the line of the face, viewed from the side, is convex and<lb/>
increasingly so towards the nostrils, it is termed " Roman nosed " ; the<lb/>
reverse, viz., a concave line from the forehead to the nose, being called<lb/>
"stag-faced" or "dished." An abnormally large and long head is some-<lb/>
times spoken of as " like a coffin," and when viewed from the front the<lb/>
resemblance is not far-fetched.
</p>

<p>
The ears should, as a rule, be carried upright and forward (" pricked "), The ears,<lb/>
though they will naturally move very frequently as the attention is<lb/>
attracted to sounds from various directions. "Lop ears," which flop<lb/>
down sideways, usually denote a want of energy and are very ugly, but<lb/>
they may occasionally be seen in well-bred horses. Bad-tempered horses<lb/>
frequently carry their ears flat back against the side of the neck when<lb/>
they are approached or about to kick.
</p>

<p>
The eye should be set well out at the side of the head so as to The eye.<lb/>
command a wide range of vision, and the eye-ball should be neither too<lb/>
prominent nor too deeply placed in the socket. Bad-tempered horses<lb/>
frequently show the white of the eye in looking backwards.
</p>

22 ANIMAL MANAGEMENT.
</p>

<p>
There should be a sufficient width between the branches of the jaw<lb/>
(the jowl) to give ample room for the top of the windpipe.
</p>

<p>
A small head is less weight to carry ; width between the eyes indicates<lb/>
a good field of vision, and the animal is not so likely to be nervous as<lb/>
one with less ample range of sight ; well-opened nostrils and width of<lb/>
jowl give capacity for easy breathing during exertion ; while depth of jaw<lb/>
and width between its branches show that the animal is possessed of<lb/>
good masticating power which has an effect on digestion and con-<lb/>
sequently on condition. On the other hand, the lop-ear and pendulous lip<lb/>
denote a lymphatic temperament or paralysis of the parts, while the laid-<lb/>
back ear and deep-set pig-eye with the white showing as it glances back-<lb/>
wards are unmistakable evidence of bad temper.
</p>

<p>
Although in no point of conformation are there greater differences to<lb/>
be found than in the head and no part in which the influence of blood<lb/>
shows more marked characteristics for good or ill, still in the purchase of<lb/>
a large number of horses it would have to be a very marked and extra-<lb/>
ordinary fault in the head which alone would cause the rejection of a horse.<lb/>
Generally speaking, the worst fault as regards the head is excessive size<lb/>
and weight, and although the dealer's criticism, "You don't ride his<lb/>
head," is true in a sense, still, with a tired and possibly weak horse on a<lb/>
long journey (common conditions on service), stumbling is likely<lb/>
to be induced by this particular conformation. As an index of<lb/>
disposition and temper, the head has always been the subject of remark,<lb/>
and there is, as a rule, undoubtedly a great deal in its expression and<lb/>
conformation which gives an insight into the general character ; the lean,<lb/>
stag-faced head of the nervous thoroughbred, with prominent eyes,<lb/>
constantly moving ears and nostrils expanding at every sight and sound<lb/>
being a familiar example which most must have seen ; whilst the pig-eyed<lb/>
animal with a bump on his forehead is a type commonly associated<lb/>
with a wilfulness and obstinacy which call for equal determination on the<lb/>
rider's part.
</p>

<p>
The set on of the head to the neck is a matter of importanec as<lb/>
regards the ease of control we are able to exercise over the animal, and it<lb/>
is fortunate that the conformation most pleasing to the eye is also the one<lb/>
which gives greatest power to the rider. Just behind the lower jaw there<lb/>
is in a well set on bead a narrowness and looseness of the part which<lb/>
gives the impression of lightness and free mobility, especially when viewed<lb/>
from the side, though when seen from above (as when riding or driving)<lb/>
it will be noticed that the junction is strong and well clothed with muscles.
</p>

<p>

neck^ which offers several varieties of shape. The upper border from poll

THE POINTS OF THE HORSE, ETC. 23

<p>
to withers and from which the mane springs is called the " crest," and it The crest,<lb/>
attains a much greater development in entire horses than in mares or<lb/>
geldings, being in some instances so high and heavy as to lop over to one<lb/>
side. For fast working horses, and especially those which have to travel<lb/>
far, this is a very undesirable conformation, as it adds to the burden<lb/>
carried by the forelegs, which normally support more than half the<lb/>
animal's entire weight, and the neck should therefore be as light as<lb/>
consistent with strength. Length as well as lightness is a point which<lb/>
should be sought for in the neck of any horse intended for fast work, as<lb/>
the muscles which lift and move forward the shoulders lie along it, and<lb/>
length of muscles, generally speaking, means ease and quickness of move-<lb/>
ment ; on the other hand, a short, strong, bulky neck is regarded by<lb/>
some as the ideal for draught horses, and is said to enable the animal to<lb/>
put weight into the collar. A careful inspection of heavy horses, however,<lb/>
shows that many of them have as long necks as other breeds, though<lb/>
their extreme muscularity and bulk may give the appearance of shortness<lb/>
to the eye.
</p>

<p>
Strength is imperative in this as in all other points of the horse : the Strength<lb/>
neck must be sufficiently strong and muscular not only to lift and pull of neck,<lb/>
forward the foreleg, but also to sustain the constant weight of the head.<lb/>
This strength and muscularity is perhaps most fully realised when one is<lb/>
in the saddle, for it may then be seen that the beautifully curved neck<lb/>
which gave such an impression of grace and lightness w^hen looked at<lb/>
from the side is nevertheless sufficiently thick and full of muscle when<lb/>
seen from above ; while a weak neck, on the other hand, immediately<lb/>
strikes one as thin and wanting strength when viewed from the same<lb/>
position.
</p>

<p>
The line of the crest from poll to withers should be firm to the feel,<lb/>
and form a pleasing curve, with a slight dip just in front of the latter,<lb/>
whilst the lower part of the neck which accommodates the windpipe,<lb/>
gullet, and great blood-vessels which go from and to the head, should be<lb/>
loose and flexible.
</p>

<p>
The junction of the neck with the shoulder presents a long narrow Junction<lb/>
triangular surface, from the withers down to the point of the shoulder, of neck<lb/>
against which when in draught the body side of the collar rests, and on ^"^<lb/>
this account an accentuation of it and consequent width between the ^ ^Â°" ^^'<lb/>
points of the shoulders may be a desirable feature in heavy draught horses.<lb/>
In fast-working saddle horses it is not only undesirable but a positive<lb/>
drawback, and in such the junction of the neck and shoulder should be<lb/>
rather a slipping of one into the other than a sharply defined . space<lb/>
between the two.

The best type of neck for saddle horses, combining sufficient length and<lb/>
strength with graceful carriage, lightness and good set on of head, is<lb/>
most often seen in the Arab, hunter and racehorse, whilst the typical<lb/>
heavy draught neck may be seen in the Shire and the Clydesdale.
</p>

<p>
A ewe neck is one in which the curve is the wrong way, the same<lb/>
shape as that of the sheep. With this variety, the head is set on at an<lb/>
angle which is too horizontal, and consequently when going the animal<lb/>
pokes out the muzzle and looks upwards ("a star gazer"), rendering<lb/>
control difficult unless a standing martingale is worn.

A bull neck is short, thick and bulky, very strong but not very flexible,<lb/>
often carried in a more or less horizontal position, and associated<lb/>
with the habit of " boring," i.e.^ leaning the weight of the head and neck<lb/>
constantly on the bit.
</p>

<p>
A " cock-throttled^'' or 'â ^ swan-fiecked" horse is one which has a neck<lb/>
like a fowl. The set on of the head maybe good and the commencement<lb/>
of the curve of the neck correct, but towards the lower part it tends<lb/>
to become ewe-necked. With this formation the head is held high : if<lb/>
accentuated is a very unpleasant conformation to ride, though in a slight<lb/>
degree only it occasions no inconvenience.
</p>

<p>
The 77iajie a?id forelock is not very voluminous in thoroughbred<lb/>
animals ; and composed of perfectly straight hair which lies to one side or<lb/>
other of the neck, in heavy, and especially under-bred heavy horses, it is<lb/>
very plentiful, the hair having a tendency to get wavy or curly, and some-<lb/>
times it divides down the centre and falls both sides of the neck.
</p>

<p>
The withers commence from the dip where the neck ends, and rising<lb/>
slightly over the tops of the shoulder blades, slope away into the back.<lb/>
The rise of the withers is formed by the long spines which, in this<lb/>
situation, project upwards from the bones of the back, and as they are<lb/>
immediately under the skin they are particularly liable to injury by any<lb/>
pressure upon them from above. The truly formed wither for a riding<lb/>
horse should be of medium height only and neither too narrow or fine,<lb/>
nor too thick ; a moderate height being essential to afford surface for the<lb/>
attachment of the upward prolongation of the shoulder blades and their<lb/>
covering muscles. Very high withers are generally too " fine," or narrow,<lb/>
and are not only more liable to injury from the saddle by reason of their<lb/>
actual height, but their narrowness renders this injury more likely, owing<lb/>
to the want of sufficient widlh to support the saddle, which is a very<lb/>
serious matter in the troop horse. Low, thick withers are undesirable for<lb/>
riding horses, and though some Arabs and ponies, must be exempted from<lb/>
the criticism they are usually found in types which are more intended for<lb/>
draught than saddle.

THE POINTS OF THE HORSE, ETC. 2$
</p>

<p>
The back is a rather indefinite term, by which is sometimes meant the The back,<lb/>
whole length of the trunk from the withers to the croup, and sometimes<lb/>
that limited region on which a hunting saddle rests. This latter is the<lb/>
part now alluded to, viz., from behind the withers to the front of the loins<lb/>
on each side of the spine. On this comparatively small space the whole,<lb/>
or practically the whole, of the saddle load rests, for the withers in front<lb/>
and the loins behind cannot sustain pressure without injury.
</p>

<p>
The typical back for all military horses is a short, strong one, level<lb/>
from the dip behind the withers or rising very slightly towards the loins ;<lb/>
a long back is, other things being equal, a weak one, and may often be<lb/>
found in conjunction with shallow back ribs and weak loins, a conformation<lb/>
ill-suited for the rigorous conditions of war. Short, muscular, strong<lb/>
backs, on the other hand, are usually found associated with the good, well<lb/>
ribbed up bodies and powerful loins, which denote strength.
</p>

<p>
When the slope of the withers into the back is deeper than usual, the<lb/>
horse is said to be " dipped " in the back ; a " hollow" back is an exaggera-<lb/>
tion of this condition carried up to the loins, and a " roach " back is the<lb/>
opposite formation, viz., an upward curve of back and loin. When the<lb/>
animal is as round as an apple and in good hard fettle, it will be seen,<lb/>
particularly after work, that the muscles on each side of the centre line of<lb/>
the spine stand up so prominently that there is a slight ditch down the<lb/>
middle of the back, but when from want of flesh the central spines of the<lb/>
back bone are the more prominent, they form a sharp ridge or " razor "<lb/>
back. The " razor " back may, of course, be due only to want of muscle<lb/>
which judicious rest, food, and work will produce, but if it is a natural<lb/>
conformation it is a very bad fault and found in conjunction with flat sides,<lb/>
narrow loins and weak quarters.
</p>

<p>
All horses, especially those which constantly carry heavy weights,<lb/>
tend of course to become more hollow in the back with advancing<lb/>
age, and when the condition is extreme it may be not only a weak-<lb/>
ness, but a source of considerable inconvenience in saddle fitting ; while<lb/>
the roach back may give similar trouble, though it is in itself a strong<lb/>
formation.
</p>

<p>
The lorn. â Extending from the end of the back as far back as is level The loin,<lb/>
with the point of the hip is tha " Lorn."
</p>

<p>
The function of the loin muscles is to raise the weight of the body and<lb/>
its load on the hind-quarters so that the forehand can stride away. They<lb/>
should therefore be muscular. Short, broad, fleshy loins are what are<lb/>
required in all classes of horses, and long, narrow, weak ones (" slack<lb/>
loins ") are to be avoided.

The body comprises the chest, belly and flank (the two flatter being The body.

<p>
give plenty of room for heart, lungs, stomach and bowels. They should<lb/>
reach well back, so that there is not much space between the last rib and<lb/>
the point of the hip {i.e., " well ribbed up "). At the ^'- girth place '^ ]us\.<lb/>
behind the elbow, there should be a slight upward curve of the breast-<lb/>
bone, which gives the spot its name. From the girth place to the stifle<lb/>
the lower line of the barrel should carry along with a very slight upward<lb/>
tendency, not running up between the hind legs like a greyhound, or<lb/>
looking " pot-bellied," but it varies somewhat according to the condition<lb/>
of the animal under notice. The hunter or troop horse should be " deep<lb/>
through the heart," i.e., just behind the elbow, have deep back ribs, and<lb/>
be well ribbed up. Shallow bodies, wanting depth through heart and<lb/>
back ribs, and barrels running up light behind, are to be avoided, as<lb/>
they are not shapes likely to stand hardship or give endurance. The<lb/>
same applies to narrow "flat-sided" horses, in which the arch of the ribs<lb/>
is insufficient to give room for large, well developed lungs and hearts.
</p>

<p>
Many terms are commonly used to express the appearance of the<lb/>
barrel, " herring gutted," " like a greyhound," " waspy," " tucked up " and<lb/>
"light," all being indicative of smallness from various reasons, while " pot<lb/>
belly," " cow belly," and " grass belly " imply a large or pendulous<lb/>
condition.<lb/>

<p>
shoulder, jjgjgj^j. ^^^ j^^^^g ^ long, well-sloped shoulder blade. The blade should<lb/>
be muscular, but the muscles should not be lumped on to it either at the<lb/>
top or point ; rather they should give the appearance of being neatly<lb/>
slipped into their places and finished off with a plane. The lower part of<lb/>
the shoulder, from point to elbow, should be short and muscular, and the<lb/>
muscles which fill up the angle behind the shoulder joint should be large<lb/>
and prominent, especially at the lower part near the elbow. The shoulder<lb/>
is said to be "loaded" at the top or point when the muscles of those<lb/>
parts appear too bulky and lumpy. "Upright shoulders " are those in<lb/>
which the slope of the shoulder blade is considered insufficient, and " short<lb/>
shoulders " are those which are judged to have too little depth from<lb/>
wither to elbow. The shoulder should be set well back on the ribs, and<lb/>
not far forward and up the neck. The placing of the shoulder makes all<lb/>
the difference to the conformation of the forehand, the carriage of the<lb/>
saddle and the distribution of the rider's weight. Upright shoulders,

such a conformation carries the weight.
</p>

<p>
The arm should be long and muscular. Looked at from the side, it xhe arm.<lb/>
should be broad at the elbow with the muscles well outlined, and tapering<lb/>
gradually towards the knee. Regarded from the front, it is narrow with<lb/>
bulging muscles on the outside and a clean, hard line on the inside where<lb/>
the bone is next the skin.
</p>

<p>
The knee should be, like all joints, big, to afford plenty of room for The knee,<lb/>
the attachment of strong muscles. It should be broad and flat, deep from<lb/>
front to back, with a very slight bulge forward in front, and the bony knob<lb/>
at the back large and prominent.
</p>

<p>
" Stag knees^^ " Calf knees'''' or " back at the knee " are the terms used '' ^'â ^^â<lb/>
to describe joints which, when looked at from the side, show a concave u^^^f'<lb/>
rather than a convex line down the front of the knee. knees " or
</p>

<p>
" back at<lb/>

<p>
The camion should be short ; narrow when viewed from the front. The<lb/>

knee to fetlock should be straight, and the leg should look the same<lb/>
width below the knee as it does just above the fetlock. Good measure-<lb/>
ment below the knee is usually called " plenty of bone," but it includes<lb/>
the tendons as well as the bone, and really means that there is plenty of<lb/>
room for the tendons, and that these are well developed.
</p>

<p>
" Ginniny legs'''' are those in which the clean, hard lines which should "Gummy<lb/>
mark the course of the tendons are not well defined ; but which, owing to ^^gs.'<lb/>
general fulness of the leg, or sprain of some particular part, look more<lb/>
rounded than they should.
</p>

<p>
The pastern should be strong and of medium slope and length. Too The<lb/>
long and sloping pasterns may be as faulty as short and upright ones, for pastern,<lb/>
although they usually give a pleasant elastic action, they lack strength for<lb/>
hard work and carrying weight. The short, upright pastern means loss<lb/>
of elasticity and extra concussion to both horse and rider, and the mean<lb/>
between these two extremes is best. An exception as regards the slope<lb/>
of the pastern must be made in the case of Arabs, as in some of the best<lb/>
of them the slope is very great.

<p>
supports more than half the weight of both horse and rider, it should be<lb/>
a prime factor in the selection of saddle horses, and lightness combined<lb/>
with strength in the forehand is of the first importance for riding. The<lb/>
head should be light and well set on, the neck of sufficient length, slightly<lb/>
arched along the crest from poll to withers, light in appearance, but<lb/>
muscular and strong. The shoulders should be deep, well placed, and<lb/>
the blades set at a sufficient slope. Here, again, the appearance of<lb/>
lightness combined with actual muscular development should be looked<lb/>
for ; heavy, lumpy shoulders, especially when upright and placed forward,<lb/>
are the worst type for the saddle. The legs from the arm down should<lb/>
drop straight and true to the foot, the toes being turned neither in nor<lb/>
out, and with plenty of bone below the knee. This last is important, as the<lb/>
strain on the tendons is, in any case, great ; and if they are " tied,'' z&amp;gt;.,<lb/>
thrown out of the straight line, and given insufficient room at the knee,<lb/>
the tension on them at a fast pace is so much increased that they are<lb/>
more likely to be sprained, and this extra risk rightly causes great<lb/>
attention to be paid to this part. If the toes are turned out from the<lb/>
fetlock, " brushing " is likely to occur, and the liability is greatest when<lb/>
the horse is fatigued. The fetlock of a horse which turns his toe out<lb/>
is bent inwards as well as backwards when the weight is passing over the<lb/>
leg, and is thus brought nearer the other leg, the foot of which strikes it<lb/>
in passing.
</p>

<p>
TA^ quarters should be muscular and full of flesh, but their shape may<lb/>
vary considerably. " Straight'^ quarters^ which run nearly level from<lb/>
the croup to the dock are seen chiefly in thoroughbreds, but a " di'ooping<lb/>
quarter ^^ which slants downwards from croup to dock is also seen in<lb/>
many well-bred horses. When the slant is very pronounced it is termed<lb/>
a ^^ goose rumpP ^^ Rouftd'' quarters are seen in cobs, ponies, and many<lb/>
Arabs. When the points of the hips are wide apart, so that they are very<lb/>
prominent when looked at from behind, they are often termed " ragged<lb/>
hips.^^ The actual shape is not a matter of so much consequence for<lb/>
general work, provided the parts are sufficiently large, strong, and full of<lb/>
muscle.
</p>

<p>
The thighs from the stifle to the hock should be long and well-clothed<lb/>
with muscle. The prominent bunch of muscles at the lower and outer<lb/>
part of the thigh is termed the ^'' gaski?i'^ or ^'' second thigh^^ and should<lb/>
be well developed. The strong tendon running from the muscles at the<lb/>
back to the point of the hock is the ^'' hanistringJ'
</p>

<p>
The hock should be a large joint with a prominent point. From the<lb/>
point, the tendons of the hind limb should drop straight to the fetlock,<lb/>
and if there is any bulging over the seat of curb, about five or six inches

below the point, it should be due to the prominence of the bone in this<lb/>
neig"hbourhood and not to an enlargement of the tendons. The inside<lb/>
(best viewed from a point just outside the foreleg) should present a<lb/>
marked knob where the thigh bone terminates and from there slide<lb/>
gradually to the cannon without any very marked prominence over the<lb/>
seat of spavin. When the points of the hocks approach each other,<lb/>
instead of being in the perpendicular, they are termed 'â 'â  cow /locksJ'<lb/>
" Sickle hocks " are those which are too much bent, so that the<lb/>
line from the point of the hock to the ground slopes forwards. " Curby<lb/>
hock'*'' is an indefinite term used by some to denote the presence of curb,<lb/>
and by others to describe either a hock which they think likely to get a<lb/>
curb, or one which, owing to the prominence of the bone, looks as if it<lb/>
had a curb. When the thighs slope markedly backwards and the hock<lb/>
is further behind the animal than usual, the formation is termed " cat<lb/>
hamniedJ^
</p>

<p>
The hiiid-qiiarters^ providing as they do the propelling force for the The hind-<lb/>
body, must be muscular and of a size proportioned to the rest of the quarters,<lb/>
frame. For speed, length and depth of the quarter, with long, straight-<lb/>
dropped thighs and hocks, are required ; for strength, bulk is essential.<lb/>
In speedy horses width of the quarter is not so noticeable as length and<lb/>
depth, but it is a prominent feature in heavy breeds. Narrow, short<lb/>
quarters wanting muscle between the thighs i^'' split up^'') with cow hocks<lb/>
and cat hams are the worst types.

<p>
Colours and Markings.
</p>

<p>
It is necessary to note colours and markings exactlyas they are recorded<lb/>
for the purpose of identification.
</p>

<p>
The colour of horses is markedly influenced by breed, and is also to<lb/>
some extent an index of character, though to this latter there are<lb/>
numerous exceptions. Breed, however, has a very general effect on<lb/>
colour, which is, of course, the more marked where selection is practised<lb/>
with a view to maintaining a peculiarity. The Cleveland bay is a well-<lb/>
known example, and also there may be cited the whole colour chestnut<lb/>
of the Suffolk punch, the black Belgian horse, the cream-coloured<lb/>
Hanoverian, and the dun Kattywar of India. Whatever the horse's<lb/>
colour it should be good of its sort and not ^^was/iy." This term is used<lb/>
to indicate the faded or washed out appearance of the coats of some<lb/>
horses, and it may be generally noted that the hair on the legs of such<lb/>
gets lighter towards the extremities â Jiiealy legs. When a choice is<lb/>
possible such colours should not be selected as they indicate a general<lb/>
want of hardiness. There is truth in the saying, " A good horse is never<lb/>
a bad colour," whichever way you apply it.
</p>

<p>
The colours usually purchased for the service are bay, brown, black,<lb/>
and chestnut ; others which are not so commonly seen in the ranks being<lb/>
dun, grey, roan, piebald, and skewbald.<lb/>
Bay, ^.'?j horses vary from a light, golden or yellowish, which might almost
</p>

<p>
be called a dun, to a very dark rich shade which merges into brown, and<lb/>
midway between these extremes we have the bright, blood bay with a<lb/>
coat the colour of polished mahogany. If it is a question as to whether<lb/>
the animal is bay or brown, the fine hair on the muzzle will show most<lb/>
distinctly which is correct.
</p>

<p>
Whatever the shade, whether light, bright or dark, it should not be<lb/>
"washy," and where there is a change of colour towards the feet, it<lb/>
should become deeper than that of the body or black. Bay with black<lb/>
points is universally esteemed as a hardy colour, and usually associated<lb/>
with good working qualities. White markings are extremely common<lb/>
both on the faces and legs, but they do not as a rule become so<lb/>
exaggerated as is often the case with chestnuts, and occasionally a leg<lb/>
with a pepper and salt mixture of black and white hair from below the<lb/>
knee or hock downwards may be noted.<lb/>
Brown. Brown^ though usually a sufficiently distinctive colour to admit of
</p>

<p>
ready description, may sometimes be difficult to distinguish from bay or

<p>
black, and recourse must again be had to the hair of the muzzle to<lb/>
determine which is correct. As with bay, brown, to be a good colour,<lb/>
should tend to become black towards the feet.
</p>

<p>
Blacky though a particularly attractive colour when it carries a sheen. Black,<lb/>
and the animal is in condition, is not, perhaps, so much esteemed as bay<lb/>
or brown. It is not now so common among our own horses as imported<lb/>
ones, and this, together with the fact that a rusty black or one out of<lb/>
condition always catches the eye at once, may account for the want of<lb/>
appreciation. It is uncommon among thorough-breds and Arabs, and<lb/>
extremely common in Belgium.
</p>

<p>
Chestnuts may vary in colour from a dark, liver which approaches Chestnuts,<lb/>
brown, to a light, washy which is to be avoided. It is not usually found as<lb/>
a whole colour except in the Suffolk punch, and there is often a tendency<lb/>
for the white markings of the face and legs to become exaggerated. The<lb/>
colour is also very generally believed to be associated with a tear-away,<lb/>
headstrong disposition, and there is no doubt that some, especially those<lb/>
with much white about them, are impetuous and excitable ; on the other<lb/>
hand very many of the best horses are chestnuts, and so, perhaps, it may<lb/>
be only when the colour is conspicuous that it attracts attention.
</p>

<p>
Diin^ varying from a mouse colour to a golden dun, is considered good Dun.<lb/>
for hard work, and sound constitution, especially when found with black<lb/>
points. Mule markings, down the back and across the shoulder, and ^<lb/>
zebra stripes across the arms and thighs, are generally well marked on<lb/>
animals of this colour. It is not common in English horses, but is<lb/>
frequently met with in India.
</p>

<p>
Greys are not usually purchased for remounts, as they are conspicuous<lb/>
against almost any background, but before rejecting a good horse for<lb/>
immediate service one should remember that they only get white with<lb/>
age, many being so dark when young as to look almost black, and yearly<lb/>
becoming whiter. It is common among the draught-horses of France,<lb/>
is a favourite colour among Arabs, particularly the variety known as<lb/>
" flea-bitten," but is unusual in English thorough-breds.
</p>

<p>
Roans are of two classes, the " red,^' or " strawberry^'' and the Roans.<lb/>
'"'' bliie^^ ; and the appearance of tlie coat is produced by the intermingling<lb/>
of red, white, and yellow, or black, white, and yellow hairs respectively.<lb/>
They tend to get whiter with age in the same way as greys, but not in so<lb/>
marked a degree. The red roan is sometimes called " sorrel," and<lb/>
occasionally a chestnut roan may be met.
</p>

<p>
A '''' piebald^^ is black and white, and a ''''skewbald''^ any other colour A "pie-<lb/>
and white, the colours being laid on in large patches all over the body. bald."

On the head.
</p>

<p>
" Star^'' a white mark generally more or less rounded in the centre of<lb/>
the forehead ; it is further described as " large," " small," " irregular," or<lb/>
" faint," when necessary.
</p>

<p>
"7v*&amp;lt;2&amp;lt;f^," a narrow white stripe down the face, usually in the centre,<lb/>
and further described as " short," " broad," or " faint," according to its<lb/>
appearance. A race is also described as a " reach," or " stripe," by some ;<lb/>
the latter term must not be confounded with a " stripe " along the back,<lb/>
alluded to further on.
</p>

<p>
" Snip" a white mark between the nostrils, which may be centrally<lb/>
placed, or may extend to one nostril, in which latter case it is so<lb/>
described.
</p>

<p>
'â 'â  Blase" a broad splash of white down the face, which may be<lb/>
distinct from star and snip, or may embrace both, and even cover the<lb/>
greater part from the forehead to the muzzle. When very exaggerated,<lb/>
the term " white-face " or " bald-face " is sometimes employed.
</p>

<p>
" Upperlip " and " underlip " are the names used to denote white skin<lb/>
at the edges of the lips.
</p>

<p>
On the body.
</p>

<p>
" List" " Ray " and " stripe " are terms used for the dark lines seen<lb/>
along the back of some horses, all donkeys and many mules, and the two<lb/>
last are used for similar marks down the shoulders.
</p>

<p>
Zebra via7'ks are the dark horizontal stripes seen at the back of the<lb/>
arm above the knee and across the lower part of the thigh. They are<lb/>
not very common in horses but are usually seen in donkeys and mules.
</p>

<p>
In describing horses the above terms are sometimes called imile<lb/>
marks or donkey marks.
</p>

<p>
Saddle jnarks and girth 7narks are white patches or stripes produced<lb/>
by the pressure of the load or girth. Saddle marks are extremely<lb/>
common, in fact it is the exception to find an old troop horse without<lb/>
them.
</p>

<p>
White hairs i?i the coat, mane and tail and patches of white or dark<lb/>
hair on any part of the body are also noted.
</p>

<p>
When the coloured hairs of grey horses are arranged in small tufts<lb/>
over the entire body they are said to be flea-bitten, and much the same<lb/>
appearance is produced in South African horses as the result of tick<lb/>
bites {tick marks).

THE POINTS OF THE HORSE, ETC. 33
</p>

<p>
On some horses, particularly Australian, fine lines of white hairs<lb/>
producing a sort of wide-meshed network are seen on the loins and<lb/>
quarters ; they are termed sahnon marks.
</p>

<p>
On the legs.
</p>

<p>
White feet, white coronets^ white pastcr7is or white fetlocks are all White<lb/>
noted ; when the white hair extends just above the fetlock it is sometimes feet, white<lb/>
called a sock, and when much higher a stocking or leg. As all these coronets,<lb/>
marks are one colour the word ^''white''^ is often omitted, and the name ^h'*^^<lb/>
of the part only is mentioned. If the white hair does not completely or^^hlte<lb/>
cover the place mentioned the word "" partly " is inserted, and when fetlocks,<lb/>
black spots are seen on the white, it is called '"'' with spots^'^ or erniifte<lb/>
when it bears a resemblance to that fur. As the above may not at<lb/>
first be clear to those unfamiliar with the terms a sample description is<lb/>
given. â Off^ fore and near hind legs; 7iear fore fetlock partly ; off hind<lb/>
coronet with spots.
</p>

<p>
Horses without any white marks on them are said to be whole<lb/>
coloured, and when the hair towards the lower part of the leg and<lb/>
hoof is black, the term " black points" is used to describe it.
</p>

<p>
Other marks to be noted.
</p>

<p>
Scars in any position ; care should be taken to record those only Scars,<lb/>
which are quite permanent and on which it is evident no hair will<lb/>
subsequently grow.
</p>

<p>
Brands are to be found on many imported horses, Australian, American, Brands.<lb/>
Argentine and Canadian, as well as the famihar broad arrow which<lb/>
may be seen on those which have been purchased by the Government<lb/>
abroad. Brands are usually seen on the lower part of the shoulder, or<lb/>
on the quarter, and sometimes under the saddle or on the side of the<lb/>
neck, and all such distinguishing marks should be accurately copied.
</p>

<p>
Sex.
</p>

<p>
In general conversation the word "horse" is often used to describe<lb/>
the whole species without reference to sex, but in setting forth an<lb/>
accurate description it is only employed to designate the uncastrated<lb/>
male as synonymous with Stallion or Entire.
</p>

<p>
Gelding means a castrated male of any age. Gelding.
</p>

<p>
Colt is somewhat loosely employed to describe any young and usually Colt,<lb/>
unbroken male, but when applied to racehorses is only used to mean a<lb/>
young stallion usually not more than three years old.

Ageing.

<p>
The age of the horse may be told with practical accuracy by the<lb/>
appearances of the incisor teeth. There are two complete sets of these,<lb/>
tc7np.ora7'y^ jnilk, or foal teeth, and pernianettt^ or /lorse teeth.

</p>

<p>
The temporary tooth is small and white, has a distinct 7ieck, and a<lb/>
short fang, which practically disappears as the tooth gets older from the<lb/>
pressure of the growing permanent tooth beneath, until its remnant is<lb/>
pushed out of the jaw (fig. 3).
</p>

<p>
The permanent tooth is larger, stronger, and browner in colour, has<lb/>
no marked ?ietk and a long, stout fang (fig. 4).<lb/>

The parts of the teeth. â The surface which bites on the food or its<lb/>
fellow in the opposite jaw is the tabic, or wearing surface. The mark is<lb/>
the blackened depression which is seen on the table. It is lined by a<lb/>
distinct, narrow, pearly-white ring of enamel. This latter is easily seen<lb/>
and felt, as it stands up a little above the level of the rest of the surface.<lb/>
In the new tooth the mark is very broad and deep, but with age and<lb/>
wear it becomes shallower and smaller, till finally it disappears altogether.

CHAPTER III.

<p>
STABLE CONSTRUCTION AND FITTINGS.
</p>

<p>
Site.
</p>

<p>
The
</p>

<p>
nature of<lb/>
the soil.
</p>

<p>
Founda-<lb/>
tions.
</p>

<p>
Aspect.
</p>

<p>
While it is not essential that officers should possess a detailed knowledge<lb/>
of stable construction, they should undoubtedly have such acquaintance<lb/>
with the main points as will make their opinion of value when, as is the<lb/>
rule, a Board is assembled to decide on a site or whether newly completed<lb/>
stables are fit for occupation.
</p>

<p>
Site. â The chief considerations in selecting a site for stables are : â<lb/>
Pure air ; good light ; dry foundation ; a good water supply ; facilities for<lb/>
free drainage. Prevailing winds, and the position of surrounding buildings<lb/>
are also points to be taken into account. The position of a stable site<lb/>
must frequently be a matter of necessity rafher than choice, but as it will<lb/>
depend on the location of barracks for men, it will undoubtedly be a<lb/>
healthy one.
</p>

<p>
The nature of the soil is of the first importance â a sub-soil of gravel<lb/>
or deep sand offering the best prospect for a firm base, with free drainage<lb/>
and consequent dryness. Next to these self-draining soils, any rocky<lb/>
formation, such as limestone, chalk or granite, is suitable ; but stiff clay,<lb/>
deep loam, peaty and marshy soils are not naturally favourable and should<lb/>
it become necessary to occupy them, sub-soil drainage must be extensively<lb/>
adopted.
</p>

<p>
Dryness means a well-aerated soil and ready drainage ; dampness<lb/>
means rapid decomposition of animal and vegetable matter, a sub-soil<lb/>
water near the surface, and no drainage in case of wet.
</p>

<p>
Foimdations are artificial bases to give stability, wider than the intended<lb/>
structure, and deep in inverse proportion to the solidity of the natural<lb/>
formation. Where the sub-soil water is near the surface, they require<lb/>
draining, and in very damp localities the buildings may have to be raised<lb/>
on arches or piles. Concrete and JDrick jelly are the usual materials of<lb/>
which they are made.
</p>

<p>
Aspect. â The buildings should be sheltered from the severest winds<lb/>
prevailing in the district, and not overshadowed by other structures to<lb/>
such an extent as to interfere with a full supply of pure air and sunlight.
</p>

STABLE CONSTRUCTION AND FITTINGS. 47
</p>

<p>
Arrangcme7it. â Echelon lines are the ideal arrangement, but the site at Arrange-<lb/>
disposal rarely allows the extensive frontage this requires, and parallel ment.<lb/>
lines are almost as good. Either of these plans admits of each stdble<lb/>
or row of stables getting a free supply of air and light, which is the<lb/>
point desired. Small squares or enclosures are the worst models, as<lb/>
offering less perfect air supply, and greater chance of contagion when<lb/>
any form of sickness is prevalent.
</p>

<p>
Walls should be at least twelve feet high to the spring of the roof, one Walls,<lb/>
and a half to two bricks thick, and damp proof. This latter condition<lb/>
is fulfilled by (i) a water-proof course of asphalt, or layer of vitrified<lb/>
brick, introduced in the wall a little above the ground level, or (2) by<lb/>
double walls with a space between. This space is liable to become a<lb/>
refuge for vermin, but affords good protection against damp from rain<lb/>
beatmg on exposed faces. Bricks measure 9 inches x 4^ inches x<lb/>
2| inches, are extremely porous, and will hold nearly a pint of water.
</p>

<p>
Roofs are flat or sloping. Flat roofs are found only when living rooms Roofs,<lb/>
or lofts are built overhead. They must be air-tight, to prevent the escape<lb/>
of heated, loul air from the stable into the rooms above, and they offer<lb/>
no means of natural roof ventilation.
</p>

<p>
Sloping roofs without overhead rooms are by far the best, as their Sloping<lb/>
construction secures air space and light, besides admitting of ample roots,<lb/>
natural roof ventilation.
</p>

<p>
Maidrials for 7'oofs : â â  ]\Taterials
</p>

<p>
(i) Tiles, either flat or pantiles, maintain an equal temperature and for roofs,<lb/>
afford roof ventilation, but are easily broken or loosened and<lb/>
become untidy and leaky.
</p>

<p>
(2) Slates are fixed to the woodwork of the roof by two nails driven
</p>

<p>
through each, and are not easily displaced, but they are as<lb/>
liable to breakage as tiles. Both tiles and slates make excel-<lb/>
lent roofs if kept in good repair and they should have an under<lb/>
roofing of boards.
</p>

<p>
(3) Stone flakes are substituted for slates in some districts where stone
</p>

<p>
is abundant, but are very heavy, clumsy and not to be<lb/>
recommended.

acceptable. It should in any case have a wooden inner<lb/>
roofing.

Open Open roofs, i.e., without ceilings, may be closed along the ridge or
</p>

<p>
roofs. jiave louvre board ventilation. Louvres consist of two or more over-
</p>

<p>
lapping boards, separated from each other by a few inches, and set at<lb/>
such an angle that rain and snow cannot beat inwards.
</p>

<p>
The pitch or slope of the roof which is necessary varies somewhat<lb/>
with the material employed, tiles which are thick requiring more than<lb/>
slate ; but an angle of forty-five degrees with the horizon may be regarded<lb/>
as a maximum.
</p>

<p>
It is not possible to get all the qualities required in an ideal roof out<lb/>
of any one material at present in use, the desiderata being : an equable<lb/>
temperature in both hot and cold weather, noiselessness, non-inflammability<lb/>
and durability.<lb/>
Floors. Floors should be laid on a solid foundation, raised above the outside
</p>

<p>
ground ; should slope from front to rear only so much as will admit of<lb/>
drainage to the back of the stall ; should be absolutely impervious to wet ;<lb/>
smooth, but not at all slippery, and durable. In the endeavour to comply<lb/>
with these requirements, a bed of concrete four to six inches thick should<lb/>
be first laid and the slope from the front to the rear of the stall made about<lb/>
one in sixty, i.e., a slope of not more than two inches in ten feet. Any<lb/>
floor not laid on concrete will sink in places, and harbour pools of urine.

<p>
for paving. ^j^ Cobblestones, set in cement, are uneven and never give the

<p>
animal a good or level standing ; they are rarely laid on a<lb/>
concrete foundation and consequently sink in parts ; the<lb/>
supporting cement cracks and urine finds its way between.<lb/>
They are a bad flooring in every way.<lb/>
(2) Bricks are only suitable if thoroughly vitrified. Ordinary bricks<lb/>
are very porous, rapidly absorb moisture, wear quickly and<lb/>
unevenly, but are not slippery.
</p>

<p>
Vitrified bricks, of which there are many kinds, are impervious<lb/>
to wet, but some of them wear very slippery. There are,<lb/>
however, others which do not become too glassy, and these<lb/>
make excellent paving ; " Candy," "blue Stafford," " Dutch," and<lb/>
"adamantine clinkers" being the names of familiar varieties.<lb/>
All such bricks are grooved on the upper surface with one or<lb/>
more lines and the edges chamfered, to give better foothold and<lb/>
facilitate stall drainage. Such patterns are very various, but two<lb/>
crossed lines on a brick which has chamfered edges appears to

<p>
answer as well as any other device, and the multiphcation of<lb/>
grooves makes cleaning difficult. There is probably no<lb/>
vitrified brick which does not wear somewhat slippery, but on<lb/>
the whole they make the best paving.
</p>

<p>
(3) Sto?ie slabs wear smooth and require constant re-chipping ; they
</p>

<p>
also become cracked a good deal and cannot be called a good<lb/>
flooring.
</p>

<p>
(4) Granite setts wear for a very long time, but want re-chipping
</p>

<p>
frequently as they get smooth, and they never give a quite level<lb/>
standing.
</p>

<p>
(5) Concrete is laid in several varieties, some of which are good,
</p>

<p>
durable and non-slipping : but other samples are the reverse<lb/>
and require continual chipping to make them at all safe.
</p>

<p>
(6) Asphalt is too easily affected by heat, and gets too slippery when<lb/>
wet to make a satisfactory stable paving, and especially is this<lb/>
the case when calkins are worn.
</p>

<p>
(7) Wood blocks or any other materials which will absorb wet are<lb/>
quite unsuitable, although when treated with creosote the former<lb/>
may be very usefully employed in forges and outbuildings.
</p>

<p>
Dimensions of stalls. â The dimensions laid down for the construction of Dimen-<lb/>
stable blocks are : â Normal breadth of block, with one row of stalls, sions ot<lb/>
18 ft., with two rows, 31 ft. Height sufficient to give not less than ^'^^'^^â¢<lb/>
1,500 cubic feet per horse. All stalls against external walls. Stalls<lb/>
5 ft. 6 in. wide, centre to centre, and 1 1 ft. long from wall to centre of<lb/>
heel post. Crib-biter stalls 6 ft. in the clear between walls.
</p>

<p>
Ventilation.
</p>

<p>
The subject of ventilation is best studied here so that its bearing on<lb/>
the cubic space necessary may be fully appreciated. The object of<lb/>
ventilation is to change the air of a building frequently enough to keep<lb/>
it pure without allowing a draught to strike the occupants. Fresh air is Composi-<lb/>
approximately composed of â *^^Â°" Â°^ ^^^*

Benefit of<lb/>
fresh air.
</p>

<p>
Draught<lb/>
and chill.
</p>

<p>
Tempera-<lb/>
ture of<lb/>
stable air.
</p>

<p>
The amount of carbonic acid is very minute, but if it rises from 2 to 6<lb/>
volumes per 10,000 the air is "very stuffy," while 6 to 8 volumes per 10,000<lb/>
makes it " very offensive."
</p>

<p>
The bearing of the quality of the air on the condition of the blood has<lb/>
been already noted (Respiration, p. 11), and unless a full supply of pure air<lb/>
is constantly afforded, the body is not so well able to perform hard work,<lb/>
or to resist the attack of disease as it otherwise would be. Unfortunately,<lb/>
this fact is not at once supported by the appearance of animals which<lb/>
are kept under the most insanitary conditions ; rather is the reverse the<lb/>
case. The horse which lives in a stuffy, ill-ventilated stable may look fatter<lb/>
and sleeker than the occupant of a cold, fresh one, and this is sufficient to<lb/>
make the fresh air stable unpopular with a large section of those whose<lb/>
credit to a varying extent may depend on the appearance of the<lb/>
animal. It is only when called on to undergo hardship or when some<lb/>
epidemic disease is prevalent that the difference in health and strength<lb/>
is noticeable, and these are the very conditions under which the soldier has<lb/>
most need of a really hardy mount. A practical and reliable test for the<lb/>
purity of the air in a stable is the effect produced on the sense of smell<lb/>
when entering it. If there is no apparent difference from the air outside<lb/>
it is satisfactory ; but if there is any stuffiness the ventilation is defective,<lb/>
and the air of the stable requires to be changed more frequently.
</p>

<p>
Draught and chill. â A draught is a current of air passing through a<lb/>
confined space, like a building, at such a pace that it produces a feeling<lb/>
of cold when it strikes the skin. The effect of such a draught on a warm<lb/>
skin full of blood is to drive the blood into the internal organs and<lb/>
produce chill and shivering. The hotter the skin at the moment when<lb/>
the animal is exposed to the draught the greater is the danger of a chill.<lb/>
If the air has to be changed very often, its constant inrush will keep the<lb/>
animals in a perpetual draught, and as it is one of the chief objects of<lb/>
ventilation to avoid this, a considerable cubic space is necessary in order<lb/>
to keep the atmosphere pure without having to change it too frequently.<lb/>
Careful experiments have shown that although men can only bear three<lb/>
changes per hour, eight or ten in the same time is not too often for the<lb/>
horse's comfort or health, and a calculation based on that shows 1,500<lb/>
to 1,600 cubic feet per head is sufficient, and is a convenient space in all<lb/>
respects.
</p>

<p>
It may be objected that a stable ventilated to such a degree that it<lb/>
does not differ from the open air, will be extremely cold in winter, but<lb/>
this is really no objection ; the health of animals does not suffer from<lb/>
cold to anything like the same extent as that of men ; they stand varying<lb/>
temperatures remarkably well, and chills from standing in a draught

<p>
when heated and tired are really the only changes of temperature which<lb/>
are at all likely to produce sickness. In cold weather the heat and<lb/>
condition of the body should, if necessary, be maintained by extra food<lb/>
or clothing and not by allowing the occupants of a stable to breathe an<lb/>
atmosphere heated by the emanations from their own bodies and the<lb/>
exclusion of fresh air.
</p>

<p>
Means for ventilation. â Doors. â Stable doors are valuable additions Means for<lb/>
to, but can hardly be regarded as permanent means of ventilation, since ventila-<lb/>
the tendency is always to keep them shut. They should be kept open as ^Â°""<lb/>
much as possible, especially when the stable is empty, so that the floors<lb/>
may be well aerated. When there are doors at each end of the building,<lb/>
one may usually be kept open throughout the day, or, where half doors<lb/>
are fitted, the top half certainly can.
</p>

<p>
Windows. â These are the main inlets for fresh air, and to get the full Windows,<lb/>
benefit from them they should be arranged along both outer walls of the<lb/>
stable, one over each stall. Stable windows should be hinged from the lower<lb/>
edge, or centre, so that they may be opened with an inward slant. The<lb/>
" Sheringham," hinged at the lower edge, is the most suitable pattern, and<lb/>
is fitted to all modern troop stables. With windows on each side of the<lb/>
stable, those to the leeward should always be kept open, and in calm<lb/>
weather those on both sides. The amount of inlet space required per<lb/>
horse is not less than one square foot.
</p>

<p>
The direction taken by a current of air entering a stable is determined Direction<lb/>
by the slant of the inlet through which it comes, so that with a window taken by<lb/>
sloping inwards it will be thrown up, well over the animals standing ^''^A"<lb/>
immediately underneath ; and since it is somewhat cooler, and therefore ^'^ ^^"<lb/>
heavier than the rest of the stable air, it will descend and be spread<lb/>
among those on the opposite side. The advantage of this is that the<lb/>
air is well diffused and slightly warmed before it reaches the animals,<lb/>
and risk of draught is avoided.
</p>

<p>
Loiivre-boards are fitted under the ridge of the roof, and act as Louvre-<lb/>
outlets for the heated foul air. They should be sufficiently broad and boards,<lb/>
overlapping, and set at an angle acute enough to prevent rain beating<lb/>
in. They should be permanently fixed open ; if movable they will<lb/>
always be shut.
</p>

<p>
Ventilating cowls and tubes. â With overhead rooms, or where louvre- Ventilat-<lb/>
boards are not fitted to open roofs, the foul air can be extracted by i"g cowls<lb/>
means of various cowls and tubes, which are so constructed that the wind ^"^ tubes<lb/>
passes over an upward slant or through a narrow slit and creates a<lb/>
continual vacuum below, thus drawing up the foul air. Any patterns<lb/>
which permit birds to nest in them, or which do not act equally well<lb/>

<p>
from whatever direction the wind blows, are useless. The pattern<lb/>
adopted in the Service, viz., Boyle's, is very good.
</p>

<p>
Where there is only a single row of windows, or if for any other<lb/>
reason the inlets for fresh air are insufficient, inlet cowls may be utilised<lb/>
for the introduction of an extra supply. The openings of the cowls are<lb/>
so arranged that the oncoming wind strikes a surface with a downward<lb/>
slope, and so is led to the interior of the stable. A double tube, the<lb/>
inner an extractor and the outer an inlet, is sometimes employed, but<lb/>
tubes of all descriptions are inferior to windows and louvre-boards<lb/>
properly arranged, and should only be found in troop stables when the<lb/>
latter means are lacking ; at the best they are not so efficient, and there<lb/>
is always the chance of vermin or dust blocking the openings. Tobin's<lb/>
tube is another means of adding to the inlets. The outer opening is low<lb/>
down on the exterior of the stable wall, and from it the tube passes<lb/>
through the wall and upwards, opening on the inside at a height<lb/>
considerably above its entry ; by this the temperature of the air is<lb/>
somewhat raised before it reaches the horse, and by a slight variation of<lb/>
the detail, heel posts and stall partitions are sometimes converted into<lb/>
ventilating shafts.
</p>

<p>
Drainage.
</p>

<p>
The requirements for efficient stable drainage are quite simple : viz.<lb/>
a stall level from side to side, but sloping sufficiently (1-60) from front to<lb/>
rear, to admit of urine flowing to the back of the standing ; a shallow,<lb/>
open, surface drain behind the stalls to convey the collected fluid to the<lb/>
outside drain or sewer.
</p>

<p>
In order that the standing may be as level as possible, the stalls should<lb/>
not slope more than will allow the urine to run off, and the drain at the back<lb/>
should be quite open and as shallow as the quantity of fluid to be carried<lb/>
will allow. If it is a very long stable this drain may be made to slope<lb/>
from the centre towards both ends â a hog-backed drain. Closed and<lb/>
underground drains, although very usual in good-class private stables, are<lb/>
a mistake ; their contents cannot be seen, it is true, but they have no other<lb/>
recommendations, and as they hide the drainage from view it is frequently<lb/>
forgotten, with the result that they become foul and choked from neglect.
</p>

<p>
A drain in the centre of the stall is also a mistake, as in addition to<lb/>
the faults just enumerated, it necessitates a standing which slopes to the<lb/>
centre, instead of a level one. Private owners, for the sake of appearance,<lb/>
will have covered and stall drains, but they are more trouble and<lb/>
less useful and effective than open ones. Where they are in use they

should have removable covers and be freely accessible. All drains<lb/>
should be free of sharp angles, any change of direction being made by<lb/>
curved pipes or " bends."

<p>
sufficient volume to prevent any slight gas pressure overcoming it. To<lb/>
further prevent any risk of sewer air entering a building, all drains should<lb/>
be ventilated on the sewer side, and the outlet of the ventilator carried<lb/>
upwards above the roof of the building ; a disconnecting syphon<lb/>
should be interposed between the stable drain and the sewer.
</p>

<p>
Stable Fittings.
</p>

<p>
Stable<lb/>
doors.
</p>

<p>
Latches.
</p>

<p>
Windows.
</p>

<p>
Stable doors should be eight feet high, and four or eight feet wide,<lb/>
according to whether the men have to lead single horses or pairs through<lb/>
them. Too narrow a door has been the cause of many accidents, both to<lb/>
horses and men, the former striking and frequently breaking their hips, and<lb/>
the latter getting trodden on or squeezed against the door posts. Two low a<lb/>
door has probably been responsible for more casualties in the past than it<lb/>
is likely to give rise to in the future, as there is a noticeable improvement<lb/>
in this respect in recently constructed stables, and eight feet is not too<lb/>
high to prevent the chance of a startled horse throwing up and striking<lb/>
its head. The door may be hinged or made to traverse on rollers ; hinged<lb/>
doors should open outwards to permit free entrance if the animal stands in<lb/>
the doorway, and also to guard against accidents from striking the half-<lb/>
closed door. The hinges should be | shaped, the horizontal arm reach-<lb/>
ing well across the door to support its weight, and a suitable swing back<lb/>
stop should be fitted to prevent it banging to.
</p>

<p>
Half doors, the top and bottom portions opening separately, are excel-<lb/>
lent for stables. The top half can usually be left open â on the lee side at<lb/>
any rate â for ventilation ; and when fitted to loose boxes, the occupant can<lb/>
look out. In this latter case the lower part should be high enough to exclude<lb/>
the possibility of jumping over. Traversing doors should be hung on<lb/>
rollers from above and fitted with large smooth handles, in which a loose<lb/>
horse cannot get hung up.
</p>

<p>
Latches should be strong, easily turned and with large flush handles,<lb/>
which offer no projections for loose horses to get hung upon.
</p>

<p>
Wmdows have been to some extent described under the heading of<lb/>
ventilation. They should be on the Sheringham principle, i.e., hinged<lb/>
along their lower border so that they open with an inward slant. There<lb/>
cannot be too much light in a stable, and if possible each animal should<lb/>
have a window over his stall, the lower edge eiyht feet from the floor and<lb/>
fastened by some method which leaves no rope or projection for the<lb/>
horse to play with or get entangled in. Sash windows are unsuitable<lb/>
for ^tables.

STABLE CONSTRUCTION AND FITTINGS. 55
</p>

<p>
Partitions and bails. â In military stables partitions exist as a rule Partitions<lb/>
only where stalls and loose boxes join ; in front they should prevent and bails,<lb/>
horses seeing or touching each other, and be high enough behind to<lb/>
absolutely stop all chance of an animal kicking over the top. Bails are<lb/>
the usual fittings for the separation of stalls in large stables of all descrip-<lb/>
tions, and they may range in design from a simple wood or iron pole lo a<lb/>
deep, heavy boarding, occupying the rear half of the stall. The bail is<lb/>
either suspended from the manger in front and the stall post behind, or<lb/>
hung from the roof. With heavy patterns the former is the stronger<lb/>
method, but either is suitable for poles.
</p>

<p>
A simple pole, of wood or iron, is a sufficient stall division as long as<lb/>
the horses are quiet, but however it is arranged it can be but little<lb/>
protection against kickers. The most suitable height is probably mid-<lb/>
way between hock and stifle, which will give as much protection as<lb/>
possible to the animal attacked, and if the aggressor kicks over it, will<lb/>
injure him as little as may be. A quick release hook should be fitted to<lb/>
all bails, but springs which act automatica.lly, when extra weight is placed<lb/>
on them, are to be avoided ; they become weak, and ultimately drop the<lb/>
bail on the least touch.
</p>

<p>
Deep, heavy bails of boarding, swinging about two inches clear of the<lb/>
floor, and reaching half way up the stall, are much better protection<lb/>
against kickers : they must be strong and solid so that they do not swing<lb/>
too much when struck, or break from the force of the blow. In fitting<lb/>
heavy bails care must be taken that they are close enough to the ground<lb/>
to prevent a hoof being entrapped beneath them.
</p>

<p>
Kicking boards may be attached to pole bails, to aff'ord extra protec- Kicking<lb/>
tion. These are simply a single or double depth of boards, preferably boards,<lb/>
double, which are hinged to the under surface of the rear half of the bail :<lb/>
they do not prevent all kicking accidents, but are a very desirable<lb/>
addition to the ordinary bail, easily attached and moved when necessary.<lb/>
Of whatever pattern the bails are, they should be of the strongest<lb/>
materials ; the wood employed must be of a tough grain and at least a<lb/>
double thickness of board is desirable. Horses kick very hard, and if<lb/>
the wood breaks the offender is not only encouraged, but the chance of<lb/>
more serious accidents is incurred, if a leg gets through the gap made.
</p>

<p>
Ma?igers are now made entirely of iron. They should be large, broad, Mangers,<lb/>
with a perfectly smooth surface, and all corners well rounded. An over-<lb/>
hanging lip to prevent food being wasted when the horse scatters it by<lb/>
blowing or nuzzling in it, is sometimes found, but it lends itself to<lb/>
accumulating dirt unless well attended to. Broad, shallow mangers are<lb/>
to be preferred to deep, narrow ones, as the greedy horse cannot plunge

<p>
his mouth deeply into the food and seize large mouthfuls, and deliberate<lb/>
mastication is more likely to be obtained. The rim of the manger should<lb/>
be sufficiently broad to prevent it being seized by the teeth, as this<lb/>
encourages crib-biting.
</p>

<p>
The height of the manger for a full-sized horse should be about three<lb/>
feet six inches from the ground.<lb/>
Ha3'racks. Hayracks should be on the same level as the mangers, and not as<lb/>
may be seen in many old-fashioned stables, above the horse's head. In<lb/>
this latter position, the animal was constantly exposed to the risk of<lb/>
getting dust and fragments of hay in his eyes, and in addition an undue<lb/>
proportion of the ration was wasted by his pulling it down, when it was<lb/>
trampled underfoot and soiled as he reached for more. Where all the<lb/>
hay is fed as chop, a hayrack is of course unnecessary, and a manger running<lb/>
the entire breadth of the stall serves the double purpose. Open racks of all<lb/>
patterns are of necessity wasteful, as quantities get pulled out between<lb/>
the bars, trampled and soiled ; and for this reason a deep receptacle<lb/>
without open bars in front, and which can only be entered from the top is<lb/>
a more economical pattern.
</p>

<p>
The importance of all the fittings, such as latches, window fastenings,<lb/>
&amp;c., in a stable being flush with the walls or woodwork, or at any rate<lb/>
not offering any projections on which a chance loose horse can tear<lb/>
himself, cannot be over-estimated, and for the same reason no nails<lb/>
should be driven into the walls. Horses which get loose during the night<lb/>
always appear to have the faculty of finding and wounding themselves<lb/>
on any rough or sharp projection in the stable.
</p>

<p>
Gas or electric light fittings should be well out of reach, and protected<lb/>
from the chance of fire.

Grooming.

<p>
The objects of groomi?ig are cleanliness, prevention of disease and The<lb/>
improvement of the animal's condition and appearance, the whole of which objects of<lb/>
results may be sufficiently attained for the troop horse by a good brushing grooming.<lb/>
and wisping once a day. The necessity for and the amount of grooming<lb/>
required varies with the conditions under which animals are placed ;<lb/>
the better they are fed and the faster the pace expected of them when at<lb/>
work the greater should be the amount of care expended on getting<lb/>
the skin into perfect condition. Grooming may therefore be limited to<lb/>
the amount necessary for cleanliness and health, or it may be prolonged<lb/>
and amplified, with the object of increasing the power of the skin to work<lb/>
at high pressure, and this latter is the benefit which is derived from<lb/>
hand-rubbing and wisping, i.e.^ massage.
</p>

<p>
The importance of grooming as a preventive of disease must not be A pre-<lb/>
underrated ; whilst it is quite true that mange and many other diseases ventive of<lb/>
are not produced by dirt, it is nevertheless equally true that they are most ai^^^se.<lb/>
frequently met with, spread with greater rapidity, and are much more<lb/>
difficult to eradicate where dirty conditions prevail, and the regular brush-<lb/>
ing and cleansing of the coat is an undoubted preventive.
</p>

<p>
The relation of regular exercise to the amount of grooming required is Grooming<lb/>
another matter which should be kept in mind. It is a well-known fact ^"^ .<lb/>
that an idle horse is always more difficult to clean than one which is at exercise,<lb/>
work ; indeed it is almost impossible to keep some skins free from scurf<lb/>
and grease when the horse is idle, and this liability to accumulate skin<lb/>
dirt is of course greater with corn-fed horses than those at grass. The idle<lb/>
horse therefore requires even more attention and thoroughness as regards<lb/>
grooming than his fellow at work, whilst regular exercise is, in addition to<lb/>
its other benefits, a labour-saving procedure.
</p>

<p>
Extra grooming, especially massage of any variety, has a great effect<lb/>
in improving the general condition, and is a point which has always<lb/>
received the greatest attention from those who train animals for

<p>
any form of severe and prolonged exertion. It must be borne in mind<lb/>
that all working horses are kept under purely artificial conditions. They<lb/>
receive an amount of food which is very far in excess of their bodily<lb/>
requirements and which is converted into the extra energy which enables<lb/>
them to produce the work required ; whereas in a natural state they eat<lb/>
no more than sustains them, take little more exercise than enables them<lb/>
to change pasture and only carry their body weight. The extra food<lb/>
consumed and work done produce greater and more rapid changes<lb/>
throughout the body than would otherwise result. The digestion is called<lb/>
on to perform much more work in the same time, and the blood has an<lb/>
increased quantity of nourishment poured into it ; at the same time the<lb/>
work, which is rendered possible by the increased nutriment, creates a<lb/>
large amount of extra waste, which is got rid of by the lungs breathing<lb/>
more rapidly, the kidneys and bowels working at increased pressure and<lb/>
the skin throwing off more material in the sweat and dandruff. The<lb/>
amount got rid of by the skin is very considerable and increases enor-<lb/>
mously when exertion is severe and sustained, so that when the condition<lb/>
required is for the production of fast work it is essential that the skin<lb/>
should be in as good fettle and as well trained as the rest of the body.<lb/>
Grooming therefore is one of the means which help to make and keep<lb/>
the body fit as well as clean.
</p>

<p>
Grooffiing tools. â The grooming tools supplied in the service are body<lb/>
brushes, curry combs, rubbers and sponges. Wisps are to be made by<lb/>
the men as required, and every man should be taught how to do so.<lb/>
Dandy brushes are occasionally supplied, but are not usually<lb/>
issued : their use, however, is so general, that a description of them and<lb/>
their employment is included, as well as other articles usually found in<lb/>
stables with which all horsemen should be familiar.
</p>

<p>
Body brushes are made of stout bristles or vegetable fibre and have a<lb/>
broad hand-loop of webbing across the back to prevent the brush<lb/>
slipping from the grasp. The use of the body brush is to remove scurf<lb/>
and dirt from the coat, and for this purpose the bristle brushes are far<lb/>
superior to those made of fibre. Fibre, however stiff at first, ultimately<lb/>
flattens down from the continued pressure on the brush and is then<lb/>
useless ; bristles, on the other hand, though more expensive, do not bend,<lb/>
but simply wear shorter, and retain their upright position till worn down<lb/>
to the back. It is well to remember that as bristles get shorter they<lb/>
become less pliant and stififer, so that a half-worn brush is a very prickly<lb/>
article to bring down hard on a tender, ticklish skin, and should be used<lb/>
with consideration. In England, all body brushes are made of bristles,<lb/>
fibre brushes are sometimes issued at stations abroad.

STABLE MANAGEMENT. 59
</p>

<p>
Curry combs.â 'Y\\t service pattern of curry comb consists of several Curry<lb/>
straight, blunt toothed blades in a metal back, with a broad loop of combs,<lb/>
webbing for the purpose of securing it on the back of the hand. It is<lb/>
essential that the teeth should be smooth and blunt, and in the service<lb/>
pattern they are rounded at the top and bottom. This prevents the bristles<lb/>
being unduly worn away when the comb is used to clean the body brush,<lb/>
and also guards against injury to the skin when used for the removal of<lb/>
dirt. Other patterns have wooden handles, and some have a series of<lb/>
curved springy blades, instead of the straight rigid ones usually met with.<lb/>
At the sides small projections of the blades are seen on many patterns<lb/>
for the purpose of knocking on the ground when dislodging dirt from the<lb/>
back.
</p>

<p>
Use of the curry comb. â In the service the use of the curry comb on Use of the<lb/>
the skin is generally prohibited, and its utility is confined to cleansing curry<lb/>
the body brush of scurf. To effect this, only an occasional rub on the comb,<lb/>
brush is necessary, but its use is much abused by lazy men, who make a<lb/>
great show of cleaning the brush and do little work with it on the skin,<lb/>
the result being that the brush is quickly worn out. The dirt should be<lb/>
dislodged by knocking the side of the comb on the floor behind the<lb/>
horse, where it can be seen and swept up, and is evidence of the man's<lb/>
diligence. Blowing the scurf out of the comb is a dirty plan which is<lb/>
not to be practised ; it results in the dust being breathed by the horses<lb/>
or settling again on the coats from which it has just been removed.
</p>

<p>
Outside the service the curry comb is a recognised instrument of<lb/>
grooming. With light horses its use is as a rule limited to the removal<lb/>
of caked dirt and mud, but with vanners and in commercial stables<lb/>
generally the animals are groomed all over with it, and subsequently<lb/>
brushed with a dandy brush.
</p>

<p>
The method has a good deal to recommend it where time is an<lb/>
object ; it is quick, effective, does not in any way injure the skin, and<lb/>
seeing that this is the case, some discretion may be allowed in its<lb/>
employment.
</p>

<p>
Water brushes are made of longer, finer, and softer bristles than body Water<lb/>
brushes. They are intended for damping the mane and tail, and brushes,<lb/>
washing the feet and legs ; but they are often used dry for grooming fine-<lb/>
coated, ticklish horses, and are certainly very useful for grooming the<lb/>
head and face. When employed for washing feet, their use should be<lb/>
confined to the hoof only, wetting of the legs being prohibited as a<lb/>
routine.
</p>

<p>
Dandy brushes are made of stiff v/hisk fibre. Outside the service Dandy<lb/>
they are in general use as a grooming brush, and, as a matter of fact, are brushes.

most useful in any stable. On light horses their use is as a rule limited<lb/>
to the removal of hard caked dirt, the rest of the grooming being<lb/>
performed with the body brush, but in commercial stables they are often<lb/>
the only brush used, and are employed in conjunction with a free use of<lb/>
the curry comb. Their use saves time and labour and they are most<lb/>
efficient instruments of grooming.
</p>

<p>
Mane combs are made of horn or metal, with deep, broad teeth ;<lb/>
though convenient, they are not actually necessary and, if they<lb/>
are not very carefully used, tear out and break the hair considerably.<lb/>
Sweat scrapers are long flexible blades of smooth metal, with a handle at<lb/>
each end by means of which the lather of a sweating horse may be<lb/>
conveniently and quickly removed. Another variety has a central handle<lb/>
with a rigid curved blade, but the pattern is not so good as the flexible<lb/>
one, since the rigid blade does not adapt itself to the curves of the<lb/>
body so well ; they are not necessary in troop stables.
</p>

<p>
Sponges are commonly used during grooming for the eyes, lips,<lb/>
nostrils and dock. Though the convenience of sponges for this purpose<lb/>
is undoubted, they should invariably be prohibited on the appearance of<lb/>
any contagious disease, as they are one of the commonest channels by<lb/>
which infection is spread.
</p>

<p>
Rubbers are generally used to give the coat a final polish after the<lb/>
rest of grooming is completed, and a damp rubber may, with advantage,<lb/>
take the place of a sponge whenever possible, since it can be easily<lb/>
disinfected and cleaned by boiling, a process which ruins sponges.
</p>

<p>
A wisp is a pad of hay or straw, made by twisting the material into a<lb/>
rope and doubling it into a convenient-sized pad as described below. Its<lb/>
proper use, which is really a form of massage, is a most valuable<lb/>
method for improving the condition of the skin and coat. To make a<lb/>
wisp, soft hay or straw should be twisted into a convenient-sized rope<lb/>
about eight to ten feet long ; two loops are then formed at one end, one<lb/>
being very slightly longer than the other. Each of these loops in turn,<lb/>
is then twisted beneath the remainder of the rope until the end is<lb/>
reached, when it is passed through the extremity of each loop, and<lb/>
tucked under one of the twists. A really good wisp should be no<lb/>
wider than can be conveniently grasped by the hand, about a foot long<lb/>
and two or three inches thick ; some little practice is necessary to make<lb/>
one really well.
</p>

<p>
Rough coir gloves and leather pads stuffed with hair are sometimes<lb/>
used for the same purpose, the latter (tappees) being in common use as a<lb/>
grooming tool in India.

</p>

<p>
coat should be thoroughly brushed out, the brush moving the way the<lb/>
hair lies as a rule, though in order to get out hard dirt or scurf it is<lb/>
sometimes necessary to brush in a circular direction. To use the<lb/>
brush with the best effect, the man should stand well away, keep his arm<lb/>
stiff, and lean the weight of his body on the brush, which should be<lb/>
placed gently on the skin and not brought down with a bang, especially<lb/>
on a thin-skinned, ticklish horse. If the man stands close, with a bent<lb/>
elbow, and brushes with his arm only, he does not force the bristles or fibres<lb/>
through the coat so well, or remove the scurf so effectually. Having<lb/>
completed one side, the other is gone over in the same manner, starting<lb/>
from the neck. The legs may be done at the same time or separately,<lb/>
after the body is completed. The horse is now turned round in the stall,<lb/>
the head and mane brushed and eyes and nostrils cleaned if necessary.<lb/>
Finally he is put about again, the tail is brushed out and the whole coat<lb/>
wisped and given a final polish with a rubber.
</p>

<p>
In grooming the head it is well to use a soft brush if one is obtainable,<lb/>
and for this purpose a dry water brush is frequently requisitioned ; it is<lb/>
further to be noted that a good groom is careful not to knock the skin<lb/>
with the wooden edge of the brush when going over the bony projections<lb/>
of the head and legs.<lb/>
Wisping. Wishing as previously stated, is a form of massage. It stimulates
</p>

<p>
the skin generally, bringing plenty of blood into it, and producing a<lb/>
vigorous circulation. In particular it has a great effect on the oil glands<lb/>
of the hair, increasing their output, and thereby giving a marked gloss to<lb/>
the coat. The wisp should be brought down with a bang on the skin, in<lb/>
the direction of the hair, and the process repeated all over the body.<lb/>
Hand- Hand-rubbi7ig is another excellent form of massage and is specially
</p>

<p>
rubbing, useful for removing the loose hair of the coat as well as stimulating the skin.<lb/>
The hands are slapped down smartly on the coat one after the other, and<lb/>
the weight of the body leant upon them and the forearms, whilst both are<lb/>
moved over the skin with firm pressure. It is a method not much<lb/>
employed in England, but is much practised in the East, and is of such<lb/>
undoubted value that it should be generally adopted when time permits.<lb/>
Hand-rubbing the legs and "stripping" the ears, i.e.^ pulling them<lb/>
gently through the hand from base to apex, are both details which<lb/>
should not be neglected, and in the case of the legs, brisk, but gentle<lb/>
rubbing with the fingers and palms in the direction of the hair is an<lb/>
excellent stimulant to the circulation of the limbs. For the removal of<lb/>
loose hairs by rubbing, the hands and arms should be kept slightly damp.<lb/>

<p>
rubbing, well under an hour, and do both himself and the horse credit.<lb/>
Length of time occupied is no criterion of the quality of work done, and<lb/>
quick, hard grooming should be encouraged in every way.
</p>

<p>
Brushing the rnanc. â If the hair is at all damp, matted or kinked, it Brushing<lb/>
should be brushed till well separated, and then, commencing at the ^^^ mane,<lb/>
highest point of the withers and keeping the horse's head low, so as not<lb/>
to dirty the part already cleaned, it should be taken a lock at a time<lb/>
and brushed out from the roots.
</p>

<p>
To thin the fnafie. â This should only be done when the hair is so To thin<lb/>
thick as to be intractable, and is accomplished by taking a few hairs at a the mane,<lb/>
time from the under surface, freeing them from the rest, and pulling them<lb/>
out quickly. The hairs on the upper surface should not be touched.<lb/>
When sufficiently thinned, the mane should be brushed out and the ends<lb/>
made level by simply plucking them with the fingers. On no account<lb/>
should they be cut with scissors, or the appearance will be spoiled.
</p>

<p>
To lay the inane, â As a rule, water-brushing the mane when cleaned To lay<lb/>
and tying a rubber cornerwise over it is all that is requisite to make it lie the mane,<lb/>
tidily ; but when this is insufficient it may be wetted, plaited in locks, and<lb/>
small weights tied along the ends of the plaits. Very intractable manes can<lb/>
be made to lie by plastering down with wet clay, which easily washes oft<lb/>
when dry, and, after a few repetitions, leaves the hair in the required<lb/>
state ; or a mane layer may be used for the same purpose. A mane<lb/>
layer may be made as follows : â A round stick about the diameter of a<lb/>
broom stick is cut into lengths of six inches ; these are sawn down the<lb/>
centre and a thumb screw fitted through each end to form a clamp ; the flat<lb/>
surfaces are lined with a piece of thin corrugated rubber and the lengths<lb/>
are then clamped on the mane, their weight causing it to lie as required.
</p>

<p>
Hogging the inane. â When " hogging " is practised, the hair should Hogging<lb/>
be cut from each side and carefully edged off to avoid a sharp clipping the mane,<lb/>
line against the hair of the neck ; the forelock should be left both for<lb/>
appearance sake and as a natural eye fringe, and if a mounting lock is<lb/>
required it should be a large one, or it will rapidly pull out and look<lb/>
untidy.
</p>

<p>
Grooming the tail. â The hair of the tail should be treated like the Grooming<lb/>
mane, brushed out from the roots lock by lock for cleanliness, and finally the tail,<lb/>
straight down for appearance.
</p>

<p>
To bang the tail. â Place the hand under the dock to raise it into the To bang<lb/>
position in which it is carried when the animal is moving, and having the tail,<lb/>
determined the right length, an assistant should gather the hair firmly<lb/>
together with a double grasp, holding it quite straight, with the spot to be<lb/>
cut showing between his hands. The cut should then be made with the

shears inclined a trifle upwards, so that the outer hairs of the tail may be

<p>
a little longer than those nearest the legs. Troop horses' tails should

<p>
be banged such a length that they reach within six inches of the points

<p>
of the hocks when moving, and if the dock is too short to admit of this,
</p>

<p>
they should be left as long as possible consistent with neatness. Tails

<p>
A sweating horse should be led about till dry, scraped and wisped as<lb/>
above, or allowed to roll in a sand bath (p. 78), and, if the weather<lb/>
permits, he should not be brought into the stable till he is quite cool.<lb/>
With troops, the return of horses from work wet with sweat can generally<lb/>
be avoided by walking the last part of the return journey. Sweat patches<lb/>
under the saddlery should be dried immediately the saddle is removed, or<lb/>
have some covering left on the back till they are cool.
</p>

<p>
" Breaking out," that is, sweating in patches, is occasionally observed
</p>

<p>
after drying or grooming in hot weather ; the patches should be again
</p>

<p>
dried, and if they recur, the animal may be led out into the open for a

<p>

<p>
certain seasons of the year, and in hot climates particularly, the prevalence<lb/>
of maggots from the attacks of flies renders a close attention to this detail<lb/>
very desirable.
</p>

<p>
The feet should be picked out thoroughly at every stable hour, and on Picking<lb/>
return from work. It is a detail which does not always receive the care out the<lb/>
it should, as, apart from the necessity of cleanliness, the sole of the hoof feet,<lb/>
is so liable to injury, from accidents at work, that very frequent inspection<lb/>
of it should be made. The most convenient form of hoof-picker is a<lb/>
strong, blunt iron spike or hook, and in use its point should not be<lb/>
forced down the sides or cleft of the frog with more vigour than is<lb/>
necessary to remove the dirt. Any sharp -pointed instrument is<lb/>
unsuitable for this purpose. Washing of the hoof, when required,<lb/>
should if possible be done outside the stable, and the legs should not be<lb/>
wetted during the operation.
</p>

<p>
Washing stable brushes. â It is occasionally necessary to thoroughly Washing<lb/>
wash stable brushes, either to get rid of accumulated grease, or as a stable<lb/>
precaution against spreading disease. The usual method by which this brushes,<lb/>
is accomplished, namely, boiling the brush or soaking it in a tub of hot<lb/>
water, ruins the article by separating the back, and causes avoidable<lb/>
waste. The brushes should have the backs scrubbed with soap and<lb/>
water and wiped dry, the bristles should be " dapped" in hot, strong, soda<lb/>
water till free from grease, and then similarly dipped in strong brine.<lb/>
The latter process is essential to reharden the bristles which become soft<lb/>
in water or soda water. After cleaning they should be stood, bristles<lb/>
down, till dry. Instead of " dapping'' they may be stood in shallow trays<lb/>
of soda and salt water, but the backs should not be immersed.
</p>

<p>
Washing Horses.
</p>

<p>
The washing of horses as a general practice is to be strongly Washing<lb/>
condemned. In cold and changeable, temperate climates, it may very the bodj-.<lb/>
easily lead to sickness, and even in warm and equable temperatures<lb/>
its practice is not always unattended with danger. The only purposes for<lb/>
which the use of water, or soap and water, is necessary on the body of<lb/>
the healthy horse is for the removal of dirt stains which will not groom<lb/>
off, and for the occasional cleansing of the mane and tail and hoofs.<lb/>
The dangers which washing may give rise to are not, however, due to the<lb/>
wetting of the skin, but to want of attention to the subsequent drying ;<lb/>
and in all cases where it is found necessary to wash, too much care<lb/>
cannot be bestowed on making sure that the animal is thoroughly dried,<lb/>

Washing<lb/>
white legs,
</p>

<p>
and the warmth of the skin kept up, or a chill may result. The use of<lb/>
soap removes a great proportion of the usual greasiness of the coat, and<lb/>
consequently some of nature's protection from cold, and until this is<lb/>
restored an unusual liability to chills is present, which can only be<lb/>
gua/ded against by thorough drying and protection from draughts. From<lb/>
the same cause, i.e.^ removal of the natural grease, the coat of the washed<lb/>
horse is dull and wants the glossiness which it would otherwise carry.<lb/>
Washing of the body, then, should be prohibited as a rule, except for the<lb/>
special purposes mentioned, and should it be necessary at any time to<lb/>
break the rule, the greatest care should be taken to dry the skin<lb/>
thoroughly, clothe the animal warmly for the time ; and keep it out of<lb/>
draughts.
</p>

<p>
Washing the legs and belly on return from work in order to get rid of<lb/>
mud is frequently followed by stiffness and cracking of the surface<lb/>
(chapping). This is more likely to happen if warm water is used or when<lb/>
the weather is cold, and especially when there is a keen wind ; it is most<lb/>
common in the heels, legs and bellies of horses which are washed on<lb/>
return from work. When confined to the hollow of the heel, the condition<lb/>
is called "cracked " or "greasy heel," the latter term originating from<lb/>
the fatty nature of the discharge from the oil glands of the skin which<lb/>
collects round the injury. On the legs and belly it is commonly<lb/>
attributed to the irritation of mud, and is frequently called "mud<lb/>
fever."
</p>

<p>
The condition is a serious one and may incapacitate horses for long<lb/>
periods, but it may be practically banished from the stable by prohibiting<lb/>
the routine washing of legs and feet. Mud should be left till dry, and<lb/>
then brushed off.
</p>

<p>
It has been stated that animals with white legs are more frequent<lb/>
sufferers from cracked heels than others, and this is no doubt the case ;<lb/>
but it is not on account of weakness or peculiarity of the white skin,<lb/>
but owing to the fact that it is more frequently washed.
</p>

<p>
There must, however, be occasions on which it becomes necessary for<lb/>
the sake of appearance to wash white legs, and if they are thoroughly<lb/>
dried no harm results as a rule. The drying must, however, be quite<lb/>
thorough, and the circulation of the part well maintained by brisk<lb/>
rubbing. It is a good plan to rub a little bran over the washed surface<lb/>
to thoroughly absorb all moisture, or where peat moss is in use, a handful<lb/>
of clean moss dust, which does not stain the skin will answer the same<lb/>
purpose. In no case should any washing be permitted without special<lb/>
sanction on each occasion. Washing the hoofs both round the wall and<lb/>
on the sole is occasionally required as a matter of cleanliness after the

<p>
feet have been picked out. It is not necessary to do it as a matter of<lb/>
routine, and whenever possible it should be done outside the stable.
</p>

<p>
Horses at work take no harm from rain and may be ridden through Wetting<lb/>
water with impunity, because the natural greasiness and subsequent ^""^T" '^^'^<lb/>
exertion of the journey keep up the circulation and warmth of the wetted harmful<lb/>
skin till it is dry again. Occasionally horses which are turned to grass<lb/>
will be found with cracked heels from wet and exposure to wind whilst<lb/>
grazing, and the same thing may sometimes happen in camp ; but both<lb/>
causes are infrequent as compared with washing.
</p>

<p>
Clipping.
</p>

<p>
Under natural conditions the horse's thick winter coat provides him<lb/>
with an extra warm covering during the time that the weather is cold<lb/>
and food scarce. The extra warmth of the long, thick hair, added to<lb/>
the increased greasiness always found under a heavy ungroomed coat,<lb/>
keeps the body warm and so helps considerably to maintain the weight<lb/>
and condition.
</p>

<p>
If, however, horses are required to work hard, the coat becomes a Clipping<lb/>
positive drawback, adding considerably to the exhaustive nature of the improves<lb/>
labour, keeping the animal in a constant sweat and preventing rapid working<lb/>
drying of the skin after exertionâ as a result it is found that a loss of Po^vers.<lb/>
condition is inevitable. On the other hand, a clipped horse not only<lb/>
maintains condition, but is capable of a greater amount of work with less<lb/>
distress and is, moreover, dried and cleaned with much less labour and<lb/>
risk of chills. There is, then, every reason why army horses should be<lb/>
clipped if they are required to work during the winter ; the only question<lb/>
to consider is whether the clip shall be whole or partial, and on this point Clipping<lb/>
all are not entirely agreed. Horses working at a walk only are some- the bodj'.<lb/>
times clipped " trace high," z&amp;gt;., on the legs and belly only, but this<lb/>
method cannot be entertained for any horse which is called on to work<lb/>
at a faster pace.
</p>

<p>
It is the custom with many horse owners to leave a " saddle patch ' on Clipping<lb/>
the back as a protection against saddle galls, and to allow the hair of the the back,<lb/>
legs to remain untouched, with a view to preventing injuries from thorns,<lb/>
or cracked heels. Experience, however, shows that while saddle patches<lb/>
make the back sweat considerably, their value as a preventive of saddle<lb/>
injuries is open to considerable question, and as far as troop horses are<lb/>
concerned they should be dispensed with ; for if the hair is to be left over<lb/>
the large area covered by the service saddlery, the object of clipping Clipping<lb/>
cannot be fully attained. Leaving hair on the legs makes them harder to ihe legs.<lb/>

<p>
Clipping<lb/>
lightens<lb/>
labour.
</p>

<p>
The

<p>
operation<lb/>
of<lb/>
clipping.
</p>

<p>
Period for<lb/>
clipping.
</p>

<p>
dry and clean, but if the back of the fetlocks and tendons be neatly<lb/>
trimmed, this may be left to the discretion of the officer concerned. An<lb/>
argument which is sometimes advanced for not removing the hair from the<lb/>
back of the fetlock is that it acts as a natural drain for water when the<lb/>
animal sweats or is wet. Again, experience shows that with heavy-coated<lb/>
horses wet through from sweat or weather, those with trimmed legs do not<lb/>
suffer more from cracked heels than those with a long coat, and are<lb/>
certainly easier to dry and clean.
</p>

<p>
Altogether apart from its beneficial effect on the horse's condition<lb/>
and working power, clipping enables the men to dry and clean wet and<lb/>
dirty animals better, quicker, and with less labour ; and in considering<lb/>
the question as a whole this point should not be lost sight of. The attempt<lb/>
to dry and groom a pair of muddy, soaking, heavy-coated horses is a<lb/>
heart-breaking finale to a day's work, which should be avoided if possible.
</p>

<p>
The operatio7i of dipping. â Whether the hand or power clipper is used,<lb/>
some little skill is necessary to produce the best results, and as the<lb/>
tooth blades of all cutters are hard tempered and very accurately<lb/>
adjusted, they are easily broken and frequently found out of order unless<lb/>
carefully handled. In using the hand clipper the pressure exerted on the<lb/>
skin should be quite even throughout or the result will be " ridgy," and<lb/>
the right hand, which operates the blades, should do so without any<lb/>
pressure whatever. Care must be taken not to cut any of the mane and tail<lb/>
hair, and when the legs are left undipped the appearance is enhanced by<lb/>
slanting the boundary line from the back of the elbow upwards to the<lb/>
front of the fore arm, where there is a natural dip in the limb.
</p>

<p>
If the power clipper is used, the driving machine should be placed in<lb/>
such a position that it cannot be knocked over by any unexpected<lb/>
movement of the animal, or a barrier should be erected to protect it.<lb/>
With either variety the blades must be kept free from accumulating scurf<lb/>
and dirt, occasional brushing and wiping with a little paraffin oil being all<lb/>
that is required.
</p>

<p>
In trimming the back of the fetlocks when the hair of the legs is left<lb/>
on, the back of the joint should be clipped quite short, and the length of<lb/>
the hair above and around gradually edged off. When skilfully done<lb/>
there should be no apparent ridge to indicate where the clipping ended.
</p>

<p>
With modern clippers singeing is unnecessary, but as a matter of<lb/>
appearance, a lamp may be run over the animal occasionally to keep<lb/>
down rapid-growing hairs, which give a ragged look to the coat.
</p>

<p>
Period for clippitig. â Horses may be clipped with advantage from the<lb/>
time their coat thickens in the autumn until their summer coat shows<lb/>
signs of coming in the spring. The frequency of the operation will

<p>
probably depend on the time, labour, and number of machines<lb/>
available. If there is no limit to these, the machine should be run<lb/>
over the coat every time it shows at all long, and frequent clipping<lb/>
certainly keeps animals smart in appearance, as well as giving the other<lb/>
advantages already enumerated. Where, however, labour and machines<lb/>
are limited, it will be found most advantageous to clip at the beginning ot<lb/>
winter, say November, and again about the New Year. The idea that the<lb/>
summer coat is entirely spoilt by clipping after the New Year is not in<lb/>
accordance with fact and, provided it is otherwise convenient, the process<lb/>
may be carried on till the winter coat shows signs of coming out, when hand-<lb/>
rubbing should be relied upon to remove its remnants. This period will<lb/>
vary with the severity of the season and the individual animal. Some<lb/>
animals are, in fact, clipped all the year round and carry quite good coats.
</p>

<p>
The benefit which animals voyaging from a cold to a hot climate at a Clipping<lb/>
time when their coats are thick derive from clipping en route is evident, on a<lb/>
It is true that the long coat falls off naturally under these circumstances, voyage,<lb/>
for the hair rapidly adapts itself to changes of climate, but its removal by<lb/>
the machine at once relieves the animal of an unnecessary blanket and<lb/>
should be carried out when possible.
</p>

<p>
Clothing.
</p>

<p>
The use of clothing during the winter months for working horses Use and<lb/>
which have been clipped is practically universal outside the Army, and abuse of<lb/>
where horses are called on to work up to their rations, it is considered clothing,<lb/>
to be beneficial to the animal's condition, and economical to the owner.<lb/>
A sharp line of distinction must, however, be drawn between the legitimate<lb/>
use of clothing as a compensation for the loss of a thick warm coat, and<lb/>
its abuse, so commonly observed in England, where, in order to preserve a<lb/>
sleek appearance, several rugs are placed on the animal and the stable is<lb/>
closed against all ventilation in order to keep the atmosphere warm.<lb/>
This procedure, although attaining its object, namely, fat and sleekness,<lb/>
does so at the risk of impairing the constitution, rendering the animal<lb/>
more liable to sickness, and lessening its chance of recovery when<lb/>
attacked by any serious disorder.
</p>

<p>
Horses stand changes of temperature and inclement weather Argu-<lb/>
extremely well ; they may be clipped and kept in the open in winter, ments<lb/>
without becoming ill ; and if they receive sufficient food they will even foi" and<lb/>
maintain their condition. Clothing therefore cannot be considered an ^|g^"f ^<lb/>
absolute necessity to the animal's health, and is not to be thought of clothing,<lb/>
on service. As to the advisability of clothing troop horses in stables,
</p>

yo ANIMAL MANAGEMENT.
</p>

<p>
opinions are sharply divided. Observation leaves no doubt that the use<lb/>
of a rug in winter and after clipping, helps to maintain condition, and<lb/>
therefore working power, without an increase of ration. This is the<lb/>
practical argument for the issue of a rug to the troop horse, and<lb/>
the experience of large horse-owning companies, who have to extract a<lb/>
maximum of work from their animals at a minimum of cost, goes to prove<lb/>
that a rug is an economical provision, that condition and working power<lb/>
are increased by its use, and constitution and hardness are not impaired.<lb/>
On the other hand it is argued that the provision of clothing is unnecessary,<lb/>
that the troop horse can do what is required of him without it, and<lb/>
will nevertheless, with efficient management, maintain condition ; but it<lb/>
is certain that if provided with a rug he would keep at least as good<lb/>
condition, be capable of producing more work on the same amount of<lb/>
food, and â¢ free ventilation of the stable would be possible without<lb/>
discomfort to the animal. The modern troop stable is a cold<lb/>
stable when properly ventilated, and although this is right and<lb/>
healthy, yet the temperature of the body must be maintained, and if no<lb/>
artificial substitute for the coat is provided when the animal is at rest in<lb/>
a cold atmosphere, more of the food will be utilized for the maintenance<lb/>
of the body heat, and less will be available for the production of work,<lb/>
than would otherwise be the case. Economy and efficiency combined<lb/>
therefore point to the use of a rug whenever the horse is worked up to the<lb/>
amount of food he receives, otherwise his condition must be maintained<lb/>
by extra rations. The comfort and appearance of the animal are both<lb/>
added to by the use of a rug.
</p>

<p>
Clothing Clothing cannot of course be carried on service owing to transport
</p>

<p>
on service, difficulties and the need of mobility, and this is used as an argument<lb/>
against its use in peace, but judging from experience, animals which<lb/>
have been used to a rug endure the rigours of active service quite as<lb/>
well as any others, and on this head nothing need be feared, as the<lb/>
horse does not get ill from cold, and the coat rapidly adapts itself to<lb/>
climatic conditions. Provided horses get plenty to eat, they take no<lb/>
harm from exposure.
</p>

<p>
When to When allowed, rugs should be worn in the stable and camp only ;
</p>

<p>
be worn, under no circumstances should they be permitted whilst horses are at<lb/>
exercise or work, and if mange occurs they should be withdrawn till the<lb/>
outbreak is over.
</p>

<p>
Patterns and Yit of Clothing.
</p>

<p>
In the Service the only kind of clothing issued is a shaped stable rug,<lb/>
and is all that is necessary ; but generally the term "clothing" as applied

<p>
to horses, comprises a hood, pad, roller, breast piece and quarter sheet.<lb/>
With the exception of the hood, all these articles are combined in a<lb/>
shaped rug which fastens across the chest and has a surcingle stitched<lb/>
on. Some rugs fasten centrally on the breast, whilst others have a flap<lb/>
which buckles on the side, the latter being the better plan, as it prevents<lb/>
the front being blown up when in camp. For a similar reason a well<lb/>
fitting " fillet string" should be fastened round the quarters to prevent the<lb/>
wind blowing the rug over the back, which not only defeats its purpose,<lb/>
but may stampede the horse ; if not issued already fitted, this detail<lb/>
should be added locally.
</p>

<p>
The fit at the neck is another point which should be looked to, very The fit at<lb/>
often the opening is much too large and as a consequence the rug the neck,<lb/>
gradually works back over the shoulders till the top is drawn tightly<lb/>
across the withers and may cause a sore from pressure. When surcingles<lb/>
are stitched on a space of four inches should be left free where the web<lb/>
passes over the backbone or shrinkage from wet may cause injury<lb/>
by tight pressure. A well-fitting rug should embrace the neck like a<lb/>
collar, but in rather looser fashion, cover the body down to the level of<lb/>
the elbows and extend as far back as the dock ; the fillet string should be<lb/>
capable of adjustment and the buckle of the surcingle sufficiently high up<lb/>
to prevent the horse lying on it when down.
</p>

<p>
Rugs are made of thick woollen blanketing or of jute sacking lined<lb/>
with stout woollen collar check, and both are quite serviceable, though<lb/>
the latter perhaps shows dirt least.
</p>

<p>
Rollers. â If the roller is not stitched to the rug, it should have a pad Rollers,<lb/>
on each side of the spine, sufficiently thick to prevent the webbing<lb/>
coming down on the centre of the back when it is drawn tight. These<lb/>
pads are frequently so badly designed and stuffed that they do not<lb/>
prevent pressure on the backbone and a sore is the result : they should<lb/>
be thickest near the spine and thin off to nothing at their lower<lb/>
edges. Pieces of felt laid on each other, then skived off, and covered with<lb/>
leather or serge, make a very serviceable pad.
</p>

<p>
Clean i?ig clothing.â Tho. rug should be well shaken and brushed every Cleaning<lb/>
morning, and not wetted if it can be helped ; if, however, it becomes clothing,<lb/>
necessary to scrub it, as little water as possible should be used, and the<lb/>
material well stretched when drying to prevent shrinkage. When rugs<lb/>
have to be disinfected by soaking, the fluid should be used cold for the<lb/>
same reason.
</p>

<p>
Bandages. â Although bandages are not used for troop horses unless Bandages<lb/>
they are in hospital, their employment is so very general in other stables<lb/>
that a reference to the proper methods of using them is not out of place

</p>

<p>
bandages.
</p>

<p>
here. Bandages ,are put on either to keep the legs warm and the<lb/>
circulation active or to protect them from injury whilst at the work, the first<lb/>
of these uses being mainly considered here. To keep the legs warm a<lb/>
bandage should not be any tighter than will prevent it slipping down ;<lb/>
should cover as large a surface as possible ; be applied without wrinkles<lb/>
and with even pressure throughout, and not fastened any tighter than the<lb/>
whole has been put on.
</p>

<p>
Stable bandages are usually about seven or eight feet long, and<lb/>
should be put on as follows : â Starting just below the knee or hock,<lb/>
enough should be unrolled to make one turn round the leg, at a slight<lb/>
downward slope ; keeping the bandage close to the leg, allow it to unroll<lb/>
itself round and down the limb in the same direction it was started, until<lb/>
it reaches the coronet ; here it will naturally take an upward direction and<lb/>
its unrolling should be continued till the point from which it started is<lb/>
reached, where the tapes are to be tied in a bow on the outside of the leg,<lb/>
and the ends should be tucked in neatly. In this position they will be<lb/>
out of the way and not likely to be rubbed undone. As an additional<lb/>
security the corner of the loose end first applied may be turned down so<lb/>
that the next turn of the bandage will pass over and fix it. The nice<lb/>
adjustment of a bandage can only be acquired by practice, but the above<lb/>
directions will enable a correct method to be adopted. The usual<lb/>
difficulties are : starting to unwind at too great a slope and then<lb/>
endeavouring to correct this by pulling the material in the required<lb/>
direction ; and, failing to get the bandage over the fetlock without altering<lb/>
its direction.
</p>

<p>
Warm bandages put on too tight defeat their object by stopping the<lb/>
circulation, and wrinkles are very likely to cause injury to the skin from<lb/>
the pressure of the folds which lie over them : for the same reason, knots<lb/>
or bows should not be tied either on the back of the tendons or on the<lb/>
front of the shin ; they should invariably be removed twice daily and<lb/>
readjusted, a precaution which should prevent any injury from pressure.
</p>

<p>
liandages put on for work should reach from below the knee to<lb/>
above the fetlock and should not in any way interfere with either joint ;<lb/>
they should be fastened with a double strap and buckle stitched on the<lb/>
material, or if tapes are used, by a knot ; they should be removed as<lb/>
soon as the work is done.
</p>

<p>
Material of bandages should be pure woollen for warmth, and some<lb/>
are now made with a fleecy side for this purpose. Bandages which are<lb/>
put on to protect the legs from injury while at work, are, or should be,<lb/>
made of stockinette, an elastic material which permits of some pressure<lb/>
being applied when they are put on.

the tapes into a small bundle about the width of the bandage and lay<lb/>
them across the place they are stitched to, then roll the tapes inside.<lb/>
When the bandage is applied the tapes will then be outside in the most<lb/>
suitable position for fastening.
</p>

<p>
Knee caps to protect the knee in case of a fall at exercise are only Knee<lb/>
seen, in the Service, on the charger. They are made of stout woollen or caps,<lb/>
kersey with thick leather bosses on the front, which are shaped to<lb/>
prevent them interfering with the bending of the joint. The top<lb/>
strap, which must be soft and padded on its inner face, should be tight<lb/>
enough to keep the knee cap in position, whilst the lower one should be<lb/>
quite slack, so that the limb may be freely bent when trotting. If these<lb/>
precautions are not observed, knee caps may occasion the very accident<lb/>
they are used to prevent.
</p>

<p>
Methods of Securing Horses in Stables.
</p>

<p>
A head collar, chain and log are usually supplied for this purpose, but<lb/>
there may be occasions when a head collar is not forthcoming, and a<lb/>
halter is substituted. If a ready made one is not to hand, an efficient To make a<lb/>
article may be made from any rope as follows : â tie a small loop at one halter,<lb/>
end and about four inches further along tie another similar loop. Both<lb/>
loops should be just large enough to admit the free passage of the rope.<lb/>
Now pass the free end through the first and second loops successively.<lb/>
When adjusting, another knot may be added at each loop to prevent<lb/>
slipping.
</p>

<p>
Head collar's are generally made of leather, in the Service always, but Head<lb/>
webbing is occasionally employed. The throat lash may be sewn on collars,<lb/>
each side of the cheek piece, or be a separate strap passing over the poll,<lb/>
and attached to the crown piece by a loop. The fit of a head collar is a Fit of head<lb/>
matter which does not invariably receive the attention it should, for one collars,<lb/>
which is so loose as to be easily got rid of teaches the habit of " slipping "<lb/>
the head collar, which is often difficult to overcome. The nose band<lb/>
must be sufficiently loose to admit the free movement of the jaws in<lb/>
mastication and yawning which is the utmost extent the animal requires<lb/>
to open his mouth ; the brow band should be just long enough to allow<lb/>
the cheek pieces to pass from the crown down, without rubbing the bones<lb/>
on each side of the temples or cutting the base of the ears, both of which<lb/>
accidents occur when it is too short ; and the throat lash should not be<lb/>
slacker than admits of easy swallowing. The cheek pieces should end

just below that prominent knob of bone which is seen half-way between<lb/>
the eye and the corner of the mouth, so that when side ropes or pillar<lb/>
chains are fitted these will be out of the reach of the lips.
</p>

<p>
Slipping the head collar is a trick some horses become very expert at,<lb/>
and they accomplish it either by getting the head rope over the head and<lb/>
then leaning back, or rubbing the poll under the edge of the manger. In<lb/>
either case the crown piece is pulled forward over the ears and the head<lb/>
collar drops off. To prevent it : (i) if the throat lash is stitched on to the<lb/>
cheek piece, leave off the brow band, the crown piece will then ride<lb/>
further back on the neck and admit of the throat lash being tightened :â

</p>

<p>
(ii) if the throat lash is a separate strap, lengthen the loop by which it<lb/>
is attached to the crown piece or slip it out of the ear loops of the<lb/>
brow band : â or, (iii) discard the head collar and wear a broad neck strap<lb/>
which should be fitted with only enough looseness to allow the animal to<lb/>
swallow.

Boarding up the space from the edge of the manger to the floor may<lb/>
defeat those horses which rub their polls in the effort to get rid of the<lb/>
head collar.

that each log is sufficiently heavy to easily pull back the entire length of

is to attach it to a bar running from the edge of the manger to the floor '^ . ^"

Ropes a7id straps^ with wooden logs, though they do not last so long Ropes and<lb/>

<p>

are likely to be seized by the animal, and when the horse has a bit in<lb/>
his mouth, accidents are the occasional consequence.
</p>

<p>
Bedding.
</p>

<p>
The provision of a good bed is an important detail in the economical<lb/>
management of working horses. It is quite possible for them to take a<lb/>
considerable amount of rest standing, and as a matter of fact there are<lb/>
some which rarely lie ; but the more rest they can be induced to take,<lb/>
the longer their legs will probably last, and the more likely are they to<lb/>
keep good condition. A good bed has a marked effect in inducing horses<lb/>
to lie down for long periods, and frequently, during both day and night,<lb/>
and it also prevents injury to the elbows and other parts from contact<lb/>
with the hard stable floor. An ideal bed should provide a level elastic<lb/>
surface, be dry and warm, should either completely absorb and deodorize<lb/>
all urine, or allow it to drain away immediately, and have no injurious<lb/>
action on the hoofs, conditions which no material will fulfil unless<lb/>
carefully managed. The various articles which may be used for bedding<lb/>
are, straw, several varieties ; bracken and leaves ; sawdust ; shavings ;<lb/>
sand ; and peat moss.<lb/>
Straws. Straws. â Straw of any variety, which is to be used for bedding,
</p>

<p>
should be long, dry, clean, free from mould, bright in colour, and not<lb/>
much bruised in threshing. This description applies, of course, to first<lb/>
class, truss straws ; excellent beds may be made from inferior qualities,<lb/>
but they do not last so long, are more wasteful, and should only be used<lb/>
when the price admits of a larger issue.<lb/>
Yo To examine straw i7i the truss, note whether the stems are much
</p>

<p>
examine crushed and split. This detracts from its value, as once the outside<lb/>
straw in varnish-like coat is broken, urine does not drain off completely, but is<lb/>
partly absorbed by the stalk which becomes sodden, and on subsequent<lb/>
drying, brittle. The truss should be opened, and the interior examined,<lb/>
for here, if anywhere, the damaged portions will be found. Mouldiness<lb/>
may be detected by smell, and by the presence of discoloured spots<lb/>
and patches ; dampness by the feel, and probably by accompanying<lb/>
mouldiness also.
</p>

<p>
Bale straw, whether English or foreign, is less economical than truss,<lb/>
owing to the extensive crushing which is inevitable, and which lessens its<lb/>
wearing quality.
</p>

<p>
The trade weight of a truss is 36 lb., and 36 trusses make a " load " ;

</p>

<p>
a bale may be of any size, but usually they are not less than two trusses<lb/>
in weight.
</p>

<p>
As a bedding, straw is doubtless the most attractive material on<lb/>
account of its bright, cleanly appearance, and the comfortable elastic bed<lb/>
it provides when new, and well arranged ; but unless a sufficient amount<lb/>
can be supplied to admit of its being frequently changed, and thoroughly<lb/>
dried, it becomes a dirty, damp, urine-soaked mass, particularly in wet<lb/>
weather, which is neither comfortable nor sanitary.
</p>

<p>
Management of straw bedding. â Old bedding, when removed from Manage-<lb/>
the stalls, should be well-shaken up, and only the dung and short refuse ment of<lb/>
taken to the dung-heap. In fine weather it should be spread in the open f^^^^'^Y<lb/>
till thoroughly aerated and dried, then placed in wind-rows till required, redding.<lb/>
In hot climates it may become too dry and brittle if exposed to the sun<lb/>
for long periods, and should, when sufficiently dry, be stacked in large<lb/>
heaps. In wet weather, it should be spread out under cover, outside the<lb/>
stable if possible, to get well-aired and as dry as can be. The fresh straw<lb/>
should be well-mixed with old before bedding down, and kept towards<lb/>
the rear of the stall, where it cannot be reached and eaten by the animal.<lb/>
Under no circumstances should the bedding be stacked in the front of<lb/>
the stall, under the manger, where a greedy horse can eat it, and where<lb/>
he is compelled to breathe the ammonia which rises from it.
</p>

<p>
In making a bed, the litter should be tossed so that it lies evenly over<lb/>
the stall, the straws cris-crossed, and not all one way. This will ensure<lb/>
it being elastic, and not easily disarranged. The rear of the bed should<lb/>
have the loose ends of the straw neatly turned in, which is done by<lb/>
placing the handle of a fork near the edge, pressing one foot on it to<lb/>
steady it, and twisting the straggling ends beneath it. As horses usually<lb/>
lie well back, at the extent of their rack chain, the bed should not be<lb/>
made right up to the front of the stall.
</p>

<p>
Wheat straw is the best, it is long, stout, and sufficiently tough, is not Wheat<lb/>
so .sweet as oat straw, and, therefore, not so readily eaten. It should be ^traw.<lb/>
of a bright but pale yellow colour, and if it has been much weathered,<lb/>
becomes discoloured and greyish.
</p>

<p>
Oat straw is not so hard and tough, is more easily crushed, and does Oat straw,<lb/>
not wear so long ; but as it is more digestible, and sweeter to the taste,<lb/>
it makes excellent ctiaff either alone or when mixed with hay. In colour<lb/>
it should be a bright golden.
</p>

<p>
Barley straw is not suitable for bedding ; the awns on the ears are so Barley<lb/>
prickly that they may cause an irritation of the skin, and if eaten, colic, straw.
</p>

<p>
Rye straw is the toughest of all, and wears longest, but it is scarce Rye<lb/>
and dear, there being another market for the limited supply as a stuffing straw.

for collars. The straws are finer than wheat, and the colour not so<lb/>
bright.
</p>

<p>
Bracken and leaves are, at the best, inferior bedding materials, but are<lb/>
sometimes made use of in the country as a matter of economy. They<lb/>
are not very absorbent, nor do they act well as drainers, so that except<lb/>
as an emergency bed, for which use might occasionally arise in camp,<lb/>
they are not likely to be met in the Service.
</p>

<p>
Sawdust may be utilized when it can be obtained in plenty, but owing<lb/>
to its liability to rapid fermentation, it cannot be successfully employed<lb/>
unless the supply is ample. In any case only sawdust from well-<lb/>
seasoned wood is suitable, green sawdust becoming hot as soon as it is<lb/>
pressed together in the bed and soiled by the urine. As with all<lb/>
absorbent litters, stable drains should be stopped before the bed is laid, or<lb/>
it will fill and choke them ; the soiled portions must be removed at every<lb/>
opportunity and the whole well turned and aerated daily. If these<lb/>
precautions are not observed, the sawdust gets hot, and rapidly becomes<lb/>
fly-blown and full of maggots.
</p>

<p>
Shavi7io;s are occasionally used in the neighbourhood of factories<lb/>
which produce them in quantity. They make a fair bed, are not so liable<lb/>
to get hot as sawdust, but are not so absorbent, and often contain small<lb/>
blocks and chips of wood which must be carefully picked out before<lb/>
use.
</p>

<p>
Sand under favourable conditions makes a most excellent bedding,<lb/>
but is unsuited for damp, cold climates. In hot, dry weather and<lb/>
especially where the stable floors are not impervious to wet, it makes a<lb/>
comfortable, sanitary bed and is much liked by horses. Sand free from<lb/>
any trace of salt must be used, or horses will eat large quantities and<lb/>
suffer from serious sand colic.
</p>

<p>
A sa?id bat/i, i.e., a large circular bed, several inches deep, is an<lb/>
excellent addition to any stable ; horses thoroughly enjoy a roll on it<lb/>
when they return hot from work, and it dries them at once. It is<lb/>
occasionally stated that sand spoils the coat, but the objection has no<lb/>
foundation in fact.
</p>

<p>
Peat 7noss makes excellent bedding ; it is very highly absorbent,<lb/>
gives a firm but elastic surface, sufficiently warm, yet cool to the feet, and<lb/>
is a deodo];iser of" the urine. To this last quality some of the faults of<lb/>
which it has been accused can be traced, for there being no smell in the<lb/>
stable, sufficient attention may not have been paid to the litter, with the<lb/>
result that horses' feet have suffered. Peat moss requires the same<lb/>
attention as any other absorbent litter, and if this is not given, it will<lb/>
have the same effect as any other urine-saturated material, namely, to rot
</p>

<p>
the horn of the foot, and cause an eruption on the skin from contact with<lb/>
it when lying down. These conditions are hkely to occur if the so-called<lb/>
" continental " system of allowing bedding to remain down for long periods<lb/>
without any sanitary attention, is adopted. The soiled portions should be<lb/>
removed daily and during the day the litter should be swept to the sides<lb/>
of the stalls. With care it is possible to leave the unsoiled portions down<lb/>
for a few days in boxes and partitioned stalls, but very careful attention<lb/>
to the removal of soiled portions is called for, since, as already pointed<lb/>
out, the absence of smell may lead to neglect of sanitary precaution in this<lb/>
matter.
</p>

<p>
Good peat moss should contain no earthy matter, but consist of close-<lb/>
fibred lumps of moss, which can be easily broken by the hand, but which<lb/>
hold closely together by their interwoven threads. A certain quantity of<lb/>
other plants, often the variety called "horsetail " (equisetum), is unavoid-<lb/>
able, but any amount of stones or dirt, or a dark earthy appearance,<lb/>
stamp it as a bad sample.
</p>

<p>
General 7ioies on bedding. â Before using any absorbent litter. General<lb/>
securely block all stable drains ; if this is not done, the material will get notes on<lb/>
down, gradually choke them, and render them very troublesome if they bedding.<lb/>
are required at any future time.
</p>

<p>
A wooden or brick ledge, or, in hot climates, a mud rim, at the back<lb/>
of a sand, sawdust, or peat moss bed, helps to keep it tidy.
</p>

<p>
When sand is being used and the weather is cold, a layer of straw on<lb/>
the top makes a very comfortable bed. Generally speaking sand is not a<lb/>
good litter in England, but an exception must be made in favour of the<lb/>
sand bath, which is a great enjoyment to horses and a good means of<lb/>
drying them rapidly.
</p>

<p>
Dung should be removed from the beds as soon as passed if possible<lb/>
as it is otherwise trodden into the litter and increases wastage.
</p>

<p>
In order to induce horses to take plenty of rest it is a good plan to<lb/>
keep them bedded down as much as possible, a comparatively simple<lb/>
matter with peat moss, but one which requires more management where<lb/>
straw is used and the quantity limited. In order to check waste as far as<lb/>
possible, the litter should not be put down until the horses are done over,<lb/>
and since they often stale as soon as the bed is under them, a handful of<lb/>
the worst should be shaken under the geldings, and the back of the stall<lb/>
littered last ; the wet straw and urine can then be removed and a dry<lb/>
bed left.
</p>

<p>
A system of leaving the litter down constantly, and adding fresh Conti-<lb/>
bedding to the mass daily without further attention, is practised in some nental<lb/>
parts of the Continent, and has been tried in our own stables. It systems.

certainly provided a thick, soft standing, but the greater part of the<lb/>
bed worked gradually to the rear of the stall and became a dung heap<lb/>
which, when it was removed, rendered the stables unbearable. In a<lb/>
drier, less variable climate the plan may be feasible from the point of<lb/>
view of keeping a thick bed under the horses, but it can never be a<lb/>
sanitary method and is to be condemned on this account.
</p>

<p>
Stable Tricks and Vices.
</p>

<p>
Horses should be kept out of the stable as long as possible daily,<lb/>
for long hours of work are a distinct preventive of stable tricks and<lb/>
vices as well as beneficial to the general health and condition.
</p>

<p>
Weaving is a nervous habit acquired by many wild animals in<lb/>
captivity, and occasionally by horses ; the animal rocks itself to and fro<lb/>
continually, sometimes lifting each forefoot in turn as the body is<lb/>
swayed to the opposite side. As the collar chain is drawn through<lb/>
the manger ring at each motion the habit is often accompanied by a<lb/>
good deal of noise, and while some do it constantly, others practise it<lb/>
at intervals only. Seeing that a constant weaver gives himself no rest,<lb/>
and that the habit is incurable, it must necessarily take a great deal<lb/>
out of animals which practise it, though no special accident or disease<lb/>
can be directly attributed to it. It is advisable that they should be<lb/>
kept apart, so that others are not disturbed, and do not learn the trick<lb/>
from observation : it is also well to provide weavers with a bedding,<lb/>
e.g., peat moss, which will not readily slip from under the feet, and to<lb/>
give them a head rope or strap instead of a noisy chain.
</p>

<p>
Windsucking and Oib-biting. â A windsucker is an animal that<lb/>
swallows air by arching its neck, drawing its head towards its chest,<lb/>
and giving a gulp. A crib-biter achieves the same end, but leans on<lb/>
or catches hold of the manger with the teeth in order to get a firm<lb/>
purchase, and at the moment he gulps, a characteristic " grunt " is<lb/>
emitted. Horses are prone to learn these two vicious habits from their<lb/>
neighbours ; once acquired they are never forgotten, and are incurable,<lb/>
though much may be done to prevent horses indulging in them until<lb/>
they learn to outwit the preventive. For both windsuckers and crib-<lb/>
biters, a broad strap, fitting tightly round the top of the neck, with a<lb/>
small wooden or metal gullet plate stitched on so that it projects on<lb/>
each side and sticks into the throat when the head is bent, will stop<lb/>
"Fhite" both habits whilst the discomfort is sufficiently great. A "flute" bit<lb/>

<p>
holes throughout its length like a tin whistle, so that when it is<lb/>
adjusted, suction cannot be exerted owing to the impossibility of<lb/>
completely closing the mouth ; it is an effectual preventive whilst worn,<lb/>
but unfortunately it is not always replaced immediately after work or<lb/>
feeding, and so the animal gets an opportunity to fill himself with<lb/>
wind, of which he takes full advantage. A piece of thick indiarubber Another<lb/>
tubing, with a strap passing through it, fastened around the lower jaw variety of<lb/>
just behind the tushes, will sometimes have the same effect, but is not strap,<lb/>
invariably successful. Muzzles of various patterns with the object of Muzzles,<lb/>
preventing the teeth grasping or leaning against the manger have been<lb/>
tried, but are not sufficiently successful to warrant their adoption.<lb/>
Crib-biters may be put into a loose box with four blank walls and Four blank<lb/>

turned about in the stall and kept constantly on the pillar reins ; Placing on<lb/>
but no means of effecting a permanent cure has yet been found. pillar
</p>

<p>
The effect of the constant pressure of the incisor teeth of the crib- '"^J^s.<lb/>
biter against the manger or other hard objects, results in the fronts of<lb/>
the teeth of both the upper and lower jaw getting worn away, and in<lb/>
bad cases they may be down to the level of the gums.
</p>

<p>
Indigestion and colic also frequently result from windsucking and<lb/>
crib-biting, and as the habits are easily acquired by others, horses that<lb/>
practise them should be separated as far as practicable.
</p>

<p>
Biting is a vice more common in stallions than in mares or geldings. Biting,<lb/>
though occasionally savages may be met with in all three. A playful<lb/>
habit of snatching at the man whilst being groomed which some horses<lb/>
display, may not come under the head of viciousness, but as the results<lb/>
are equally painful, it should not be encouraged by unnecessary tickling.<lb/>
A wicked biter, when being groomed or otherwise handled, may be<lb/>
rendered safe for the time, by a thick wooden bit which prevents the<lb/>
teeth being closed ; or by a side stick. A side stick is a short stick<lb/>
reaching from the cheek piece of the head collar to the roller or sur-<lb/>
cingle and tied to each. It allows vertical but not lateral motion of the<lb/>
head.
</p>

<p>
Tearing the clothing is another bad stable habit which is very per- Tearing<lb/>
sistent when once acquired, and can only be absolutely prevented by the<lb/>
the use of a stout leather guard fixed on the head collar. This should be clothing,<lb/>
of sole leather, fastened to the back strap of the noseband and<lb/>
sufficiently deep to reach well below the level of the lips ; this will<lb/>
render it impossible for the clothing to be reached by the teeth, and<lb/>
as it is permanently attached to the head collar, it is always in place<lb/>
when required.

82 ANIMAL MANAGEMENT.
</p>

<p>
Kicking Kicki?!^^ in the stable may be due to want of work, the remedy for
</p>

<p>
in the which is obvious ; or a persistent vice which is always troublesome, and
</p>

<p>
sta e. frequently dangerous, and is more common in mares than in geldings.<lb/>
Some animals kick constantly in the dark, and a light in the<lb/>
stable keeps them quiet, but others will continue the habit in spite<lb/>
of every precaution. The following are some methods by which it<lb/>
may be combated : â The bails and stall posts may be padded or<lb/>
wrapped with straw so that noise is prevented and the chances of injury<lb/>
lessened. It appears in some cases that the noise produced is a<lb/>
stimulus to repetition and if deadened, animals occasionally stop.<lb/>
Bunches of furze or other prickly plants may be hung in such a position<lb/>
that they are struck during the kick, when the pain caused either stops<lb/>
the habit or increases it ; and the plan therefore requires careful<lb/>
watching.
</p>

<p>
Kicking boards may be slung from the bails. These should be<lb/>
thick, heavy boards, extending at least half-way up the stall from the<lb/>
rear stall post, reaching within a couple of inches of the ground, and<lb/>
hinged to the bail so that they swing when hit. They may be padded<lb/>
with sacking loosely filled with peat mo^s to deaden the sound. Although<lb/>
they do not cure the evil they are one of the best palliatives.
</p>

<p>
Kicking blocks of wood or rubber may be made to fit closely into the<lb/>
hollow of the heel, and being fastened there by a strap which passes<lb/>
through the body of the block, they prevent the heel being bent or the leg<lb/>
raised : these, however, must fit very accurately, for if they slip from the<lb/>
heel they are useless and may even increase the trouble. Another<lb/>
variety of kicking block is a shackle with a few links of heavy chain<lb/>
attached to which is sometimes added a smooth wooden ball, when the<lb/>
horse kicks, the chain or block hits him on the leg and in some cases stops<lb/>
the habit.
</p>

<p>
Attaching heavy weights to the legs by means of shackles, e.g.^ bags<lb/>
of sand, or hanging these behind the animal so that they swing back<lb/>
when struck, are harmless and sometimes quite efficacious expedients,<lb/>
and the legs may be shackled together if other means fail.
</p>

<p>
It will be noted that some of the methods given above are likely to
</p>

<p>
cause considerable damage to the animal if the kicking is persisted in,
</p>

<p>
and they should all be carefully supervised when employed ; horses
</p>

<p>
which are not cured of the habit by one method, will sometimes yield to
</p>

<p>
another, and none should be persisted in if they do not at once check it.
</p>

<p>
Gnawing Gnawing the walls and eating their own droppings are instances ol
</p>

<p>
the walls depraved appetite occasionally observed in horses'. The former is
</p>

<p>
and eating usually ascribed to a craving for lime salts, but it is by no means proved

that it is anything but a bad habit, and the presence of a lump of rock their own<lb/>
salt in the manger will suffice to distract the attention till it is forgotten, droppings.<lb/>
If the habit continues, that portion of the wall within reach may be<lb/>
covered with tar varnish (tar i part, naphtha 3 parts). Eating dung is a<lb/>
dirty habit, which, once acquired, seems to be very difficult to stop. The<lb/>
animal will even try to slip its head collar in order to get at its own<lb/>
fieces, although it does not attempt to eat those of other animals. As<lb/>
indigestion may be a possible cause, in both the above cases, a careful<lb/>
veterinary examination of the animal, and an equally thorough over-<lb/>
hauling of the food should be undertaken.
</p>

<p>
Daily Routine of Stable Duties.
</p>

<p>
The usual hours for stables at Home are : â Morning 6 to 7 in Hours,<lb/>
summer, 6.30 to 7.30 in winter ; mid-day on return from work or exercise ;<lb/>
evening 5 to 5.30 p.m.
</p>

<p>
The stable to be cleaned out, the bedding placed in windrows and the Morning<lb/>
stable aired. Every horse should then be quartered, the feet picked out, stables.<lb/>
and manes and tails brushed down.
</p>

<p>
When the horses have been watered the saddle or harness may be<lb/>
put on, the girths being left loose and the horse racked up and left to feed<lb/>
while the men have breakfast.
</p>

<p>
Immediately on return from work, after watering their horses, the Mid-day<lb/>
men should take off the bridles, put on the stable head collars, remove stables,<lb/>
the arms from the saddles, dry the throat, rack up the horses, and give<lb/>
them a little hay to pick at. Harness and saddle may be left on with<lb/>
loosened girths whilst the men change into fatigue dress ; as soon as this<lb/>
is done " Stables " should sound, when every man should be with his horse,<lb/>
and all officers and non-commissioned officers of the unit present.
</p>

<p>
The saddle or harness should be removed, the numnah being put<lb/>
outside to dry and the horse carefully examined for possible galls or other<lb/>
injuries, the feet picked or washed out, and the horse should be<lb/>
thoroughly dried if not already so, and groomed. Any injuries or loose<lb/>
shoes should be reported to the non-commissioned officer in charge of<lb/>
the stable. After grooming the horse is taken outside to be inspected by<lb/>
the officer or non-commissioned officer in charge of the stable, who is to<lb/>
carefully examine every part of him, paying special attention to the tail,<lb/>
mane, throat, ears, knees, belly, and insides of the thighs and hocks. If<lb/>
the horse is perfectly clean he is to be taken to water and fed. When<lb/>
the quantity of litter permits, horses should be bedded down before<lb/>
leaving stables.

and liij;lUs.
</p>

<p>
No horse is well groomed unless he is groomed quickly. As quick<lb/>
grooming is to be encouraged horses should always be inspected as soon<lb/>
as they are groomed and the men allowed to go on with their saddlery.<lb/>
The stable head collar should be cleaned before the horse is passed.
</p>

<p>
At evening stables the horses are to be watered, wisped, bedded<lb/>
down and fed. For this half an hour is sufficient.
</p>

<p>
Non-commissioned officers in charge of horses must watch during<lb/>
stables that above routine is carried out, that every man gets to work on<lb/>
his horse at once and continues at it until his horse is passed as clean.<lb/>
They must give advice and assistance to young soldiers, and get them<lb/>
into the habit of handling brush and comb correctly. Should any<lb/>
injuries be reported they must inform the officer commanding the troop<lb/>
or section.
</p>

<p>
The officer in command should satisfy himself that the forage and<lb/>
bedding are up to standard quality, and that no horses are passed unless<lb/>
they are thoroughly clean and have been examined to see that they are<lb/>
uninjured and their shoes are in good order. Before horses are fed he<lb/>
should ensure that all gutters are swept clean, barrows emptied, utensils<lb/>
conveniently placed, buckets filled with clean water, and the ventilation<lb/>
suitably arranged.
</p>

<p>
Officers should make a point of occasionally visiting their stables at<lb/>
various times of the day. Horses' habits and peculiarities may be<lb/>
much better studied when the men are away than when grooming is<lb/>
going on.
</p>

<p>
It will frequently happen that the horses do not return from work<lb/>
until or after the men's dinner hour. In this case the saddles may be<lb/>
removed, but the numnahs left on, being kept in place by the surcingles ;<lb/>
the horses should be watered, their throats dried, and they should then<lb/>
be fed, care being taken that they are not left in a draught. " Stables "<lb/>
should sound one hour after return from work.
</p>

<p>
It is important that horses should be taken off the short rack chains<lb/>
as soon as they have finished feeding.
</p>

<p>
A stable guard should invariably be posted while the men are away<lb/>
from stables. The stable man is not to leave the stable : it is his duty to<lb/>
unrack the horses when all have finished their feeds, tie up any horses<lb/>
that may get loose and remove the droppings. He is responsible for the<lb/>
safety of the saddlery and utensils, and that the ventilation is not<lb/>
interfered with. A horse that lies down in the day should not be<lb/>
disturbed unless saddlery or arms are in danger of injury.
</p>

<p>
On no account is an officer, non-commissioned officer, or man, to<lb/>
smoke or strike a light in the stables or near any forage.

<p>
Should the stalls be slippery, sand or litter is to be sprinkled on the<lb/>
flooring.
</p>

<p>
Horses should never be hurried in turning round in their stalls. No<lb/>
man is on any account to strike a horse in the stable. A statement that<lb/>
the horse kicked or bit at the man cannot be taken as an excuse.
</p>

<p>
Horses are particularly terrified by fire, and should a fire occur in the<lb/>
stables they must be led, backed, or ridden out of the stable. If they<lb/>
are unwilling a coat or cloth should be thrown over their eyes. Care<lb/>
should be taken that they do not break back to their stables.

CHAPTER V.
</p>

<p>
FOODS, FEEDING AND WATERING.
</p>

<p>
The constituents of all foods may on analysis be resolved into five<lb/>
groups, each having certain special qualities and existing in definite<lb/>
percentages. The groups are as follows : â
</p>

<p>
1. Flesh-making.
</p>

<p>
2. Fat-heat -energy producing.
</p>

<p>
3. Bone-making.
</p>

<p>
4. Fibrous and woody materials.
</p>

<p>
5. Water.
</p>

<p>
Strictly speaking they are not so sharply divided as shown in the<lb/>
above classification and may occasionally overlap, e.g. the flesh-making<lb/>
group can sometimes produce fat or supply energy, and the elements of<lb/>
the bone-making group may be found in other tissues besides bones ; but<lb/>
as a practical division, which gives a clear view of the functions of the<lb/>
various elements in food, the grouping may be accepted as correct.
</p>

<p>
I. The flesh-making elements are chiefly concerned with the building<lb/>
up of the body tissues, the muscles, the various organs and the skin, and<lb/>
maintaining them both in amount and quality. If a slight excess of such<lb/>
materials is contained in the food given, it may be stored up in the body<lb/>
as fat, which can be used on occasion to produce heat and work (energy) ;<lb/>
but this is not the essential function of the flesh-making elements, and a<lb/>
properly constituted food should only contain them in such proportion as<lb/>
can be properly digested and will keep the muscles and other organs at<lb/>
their best ; beyond this amount the digestion is disturbed by their<lb/>
presence, and foods which contain them in very large percentage are<lb/>
popularly called " heating," from the effects which they produce on<lb/>
the skin and digestion when consumed in excess â a familiar example<lb/>
being beans.<lb/>
Fat group. 2. The fat-heat-energy producing elements include the natural fats in<lb/>
the food and all the starches and sugars. Their uses areâ to produce the<lb/>
necessary heat for maintaining the body temperature ; to provide sufli-

</p>

<p>
cient energy to enable work to be done without the muscles wasting ;<lb/>
and to store up in the body a certain quantity of fat as a reserve to draw<lb/>
on at need. The flesh-forming and fat-producing groups overlap to some Uses of<lb/>
extent and too sharp a line cannot be drawn between them, but their fesh and<lb/>
essential functions are : the former to build up and maintain the organs ^^^ groups<lb/>
and muscles of the body so that they can carry out the process of digestion<lb/>
and make use of its results â the latter to provide the heat and energy<lb/>
required for the muscles and organs to work with.
</p>

<p>
3. Bone-making elements. These are mineral elements usually Bone-<lb/>
termed " salts," compounds of lime, soda and potash, and are particularly making<lb/>
essential for young, growing animals. Such elements are found in the group,<lb/>
blood and other tissues of the body as well as bone, and there is a very<lb/>
intimate connection between their presence in the food and the quality of<lb/>
stock produced. They are particularly abundant in grass and hay<lb/>
produced on limestone soils.
</p>

<p>
4. Fibrous and woody elements. These comparatively indigestible Fibrous<lb/>
materials exist in varying proportions in all vegetable foods. Whilst their group,<lb/>
actual digestion may not be carried out to a very great extent, they are<lb/>
nevertheless found to be necessary as providing the bulk so essential to
</p>

<p>
the rations of herbivorous animals. They also act as a mechanical aid<lb/>
during digestion in helping to split up the other parts of the food so that<lb/>
they may be readily absorbed by the body, as well as being to some<lb/>
extent digested themselves. The proportion in which they exist may<lb/>
vary from about 2 per cent, in maize to 40 per cent, in straw.
</p>

<p>
5. Water forms a considerable portion of all foods, even those which Water,<lb/>
are usually considered dry, the percentage varying from about 10 percent, propor-<lb/>
or 12 per cent, in grain to 90 per cent, in roots. ^^Â°"
</p>

<p>
A good food for a working animal should contain the above constituents Require-<lb/>
in such proportions that the greatest possible percentage of nourishment ments of a<lb/>
can be extracted from it, and a sufficient amount and bulk can be good food,<lb/>
consumed to satisfy all requirements, namely : â maintain the body<lb/>
temperature â appease the appetite â -and produce the required work,<lb/>
without upsetting the digestion or occasioning loss of flesh. If no one<lb/>
food will answer all these demands then the ration should be arranged so<lb/>
that its several components will do so in the aggregate, and such foods<lb/>
are usually described as " well-balanced." From a well-balanced ration<lb/>
the animal can extract the largest possible amount of nutriment, though<lb/>
from no food, however suitable, is it possible for the total quantity of its<lb/>
goodness to be absorbed by digestion.
</p>

<p>
A table of the percentages of the various constituents of a large number Per<lb/>
of foods is appended, and, while no precise conclusions should be drawn centages

</p>

<p>
Oats.
</p>

<p>
Experience has shown that oats are generally speaking the best of all Oats as<lb/>
grains for horses. They combine all the elements necessary for nutrition ^"o&amp;lt;^'<lb/>
in such proportions that the animal is able to consume a large amount<lb/>
without upsetting the digestion, and to extract the greatest possible amount<lb/>
of nourishment from it ; and although many other grains are successfully<lb/>
used as horse food, wherever oats can be obtained they are universally<lb/>
acknowledged to be the best, provided the question of cost does not enter<lb/>
into consideration. In England they are the staple feed, though usually<lb/>
mixed with cheaper grains in commercial stables, and in addition to the<lb/>
home grown supply, large quantities are obtained from abroad, Russia,<lb/>
Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Turkey, and Germany<lb/>
all exporting to this country.
</p>

<p>
Characteristics of Oats.
</p>

<p>
Good oats should be plump and short, of good colour, hard to the<lb/>
feel, quite dry, rattling when allowed to fall on a solid surface, without smell,<lb/>
breaking sharply across when bitten, tasting like good oatmeal, and, in a<lb/>
good sample, practically all the same size. On looking closely it will be Judging<lb/>
seen that there is a split down the under side of the husk ; a good oat oats,<lb/>
should be so plump that the kernel bulges through this split, making a<lb/>
double line down the grain. A plump oat is a heavy oat, it has little or no shape of<lb/>
beard, consequently lies closer together and therefore weighs heavier than oats,<lb/>
a longer, thinner, more bearded variety. The size and plumpness of the<lb/>
grain should be due, not to an increase in the husk but to the size of the<lb/>
kernel, and consequently some thin skinned varieties may be smaller and<lb/>
meaner in appearance than thick, heavy husked though inferior samples. Colour of<lb/>
The colour of oats varies considerably ; some varieties being a deep brown, oats.<lb/>
others black and others again almost white. Whatever the colour it<lb/>
should be good of its sort, any unusual discoloration showing that the<lb/>
grain has suffered from damp or has been tampered with to improve its<lb/>
appearance. Practice alone is the only way of learning to successfully<lb/>
judge these points, and to tell by feel whether oats are in good condition<lb/>
or not. If a handful be firmly grasped it should not be possible to Feel of<lb/>
further close the hand by increasing the pressure, for this would show oats,<lb/>
either that the grain was soft or that it was light and heavily bearded so<lb/>
that the individual grains did not lie as close together as they might.<lb/>
Thorough dryness is very important when oats have to be kept long in Dryness of<lb/>
bulk, and they should shell out of the husk with ease when nipped at one oats,<lb/>
end. In well conditioned samples some grains may be found which have

already escaped from the shell and this is a good indication of<lb/>
keeping condition. To roughly test the proportion of kernel to husk<lb/>
a small quantity may be crushed beneath the boot on the floor when<lb/>
the whiteness of the contained flour should be quite apparent. A few<lb/>
grains chewed in the mouth should leave no bitter flavour, but taste only<lb/>
of oatmeal, bitterness being indicative of dampness and subsequent kiln<lb/>
drying. New oats may smell a little earthy but an old sample should<lb/>
have practically no odour. New oats are heavier and softer than old<lb/>
owing to the extra percentage of moisture they contain and they are<lb/>
considered to be indigestible.
</p>

<p>
The weight of Oats.
</p>

<p>
Oats vary enormously in weight, some samples being as little as 25<lb/>
pounds to the bushel, while others scale over 50. What may be considered<lb/>
a good oat in one country, may if judged by weight only be a very poor<lb/>
sample in another, but it may nevertheless be a very excellent and nutritious<lb/>
feed. In England good oats may be said to weigh not less than 38 to 40<lb/>
pounds a bushel and 36 to 38 may be taken as the weight of the oats<lb/>
which are fed by the large horse-owning companies. In the Service the<lb/>
contract weight is 38 pounds and at certain stations 40. The best oats<lb/>
may run to as much as 48 or 50 pounds, and oats of this weight are some-<lb/>
times home-grown or imported from New Zealand, Australia and Russia<lb/>
though infrequently.
</p>

<p>
Weighi7ig Oats.
</p>

<p>
To ascertain the natural weight per bushel the grain should be<lb/>
run through a shoot or poured quickly from a sack until the measure<lb/>
overflows, and the surplus immediately struck from the top with a thick,<lb/>
round stick, which should be long enough to afford a firm grasp at each<lb/>
end, and so enable the striker to level the grain with the edge of the<lb/>
measure at one stroke. By pouring the grain slowly or from a height ;<lb/>
by shaking or striking the measure during the process ; or by allowing<lb/>
the oats to settle before they are struck, the weight may be increased by<lb/>
as much as four pounds per bushel, and care should be taken when<lb/>
weighing simples that none of these things are permitted.
</p>

<p>
Varieties of Oats.
</p>

<p>
English. â Both white and black English oats are equally good feed,<lb/>
although some prejudice exists in favour of the white, which it must be<lb/>
admitted are generally produced on richer soils ; weight for weight,

<p>
however, there does not seem to be any practical difference in their<lb/>
nutritive qualities. "Winter" or "tawny" is the name given to those<lb/>
oats which are sown in the autumn. Generally speaking, English oats<lb/>
are plump, short and contain a large proportion of kernel, but are on<lb/>
the other hand often of a poor colour and soft to the feel, owing to their<lb/>
having been harvested under unfavourable, damp conditions.
</p>

<p>
Russian. â There appear to be two distinct classes of Russian oats, Russian<lb/>
one small, smooth and silky, with a very fine, yellow husk, and the other oats,<lb/>
somewhat larger, rough to the feel, and thicker in the husk. Compared<lb/>
with English grain both are small, narrow and mean looking, but they<lb/>
lie close, weigh heavy, are generally in good hard condition and of<lb/>
excellent feeding value. Mixed with them there is generally to be seen a<lb/>
small quantity of minute black seeds which detract considerably from<lb/>
their appearance ; the proportion is, however, exceedingly small, and<lb/>
although these seeds are rejected by horses they do not seem to exert<lb/>
any harmful influence on the quality of the feed generally. In judging<lb/>
Russian oats one should remember that the thin, silky-skinned varieties<lb/>
are naturally of a brighter yellow colour than is usual in others.
</p>

<p>
Ccmadiaii a?id U?iited States. â The imports from Canada and U.S.A. Canadian<lb/>
are generally of medium quality and weight, with rather more beard ^"d<lb/>
and length than is seen in the home grown article ; but if in good United<lb/>
condition the best samples are excellent feeding and have a very large â^fg^^<lb/>
market.
</p>

<p>
Genua?!. â The best German oats resemble the rough variety of German<lb/>
Russian, while others again are not unlike Canadian of moderate quality, o^ts.<lb/>
They do not as a rule weigh heavily, but are generally imported in good<lb/>
condition.
</p>

<p>
Turkish. â Are usually of a nut brown colour, said to be due to the Turkish<lb/>
soil on which they are grown. They are remarkable in possessing un- oats.<lb/>
usually thick, tough husks, which gives them a bold appearance not<lb/>
borne out by their weight. Coming as they do from a dry, hot climate,<lb/>
they are generally in very good hard condition.
</p>

<p>
Australia}! and Neiv Zealand. â Resemble our own, from which Austra-<lb/>
indeed they have been produced, and they are often of the very highest 1'^" ^"d<lb/>
quality and weight. Some Australian oats grown from Turkish seed ^^^ ,<lb/>
have the characteristics of these latter and are said to be especially ^^^^<lb/>
useful for sowing in extremely dry districts.
</p>

<p>
Indian. â The oats now grown in India (originally from English seed), Indian<lb/>
are, compared with our own, extremely poor in appearance ; small ; light oats.<lb/>
and heavily bearded, with a large proportion of husk ; and although<lb/>
judged by our standard they could only be considered inferior, experience

shows that in the climate which produces them they are even more<lb/>
suitable and yield better feeding results than heavier, richer, imported<lb/>
sorts.
</p>

<p>
I?tferior Oats,
</p>

<p>
From whatever source they may spring, poor qualities of oats always<lb/>
have the same characteristics. The worse they are the longer, thinner,<lb/>
more abundantly bearded and lighter do they become, and although such<lb/>
a sample may be hard and dry, when a handful is squeezed tightly it<lb/>
will feel soft and compressible owing to the excess of beard which<lb/>
prevents the seeds lying close.

Defects,

<p>

<p>
oats. brush, or by shaking them violently, it has been found possible to remove
</p>

<p>
any excess of beard without damaging the grain ; this is called " clipping,"<lb/>
and results in producing a shorter, plumper looking, more attractive<lb/>
article. " Clipping " may not be regarded perhaps as an actual defect<lb/>
since it really results in the buyer obtaining a heavier weight per sack<lb/>
than he otherwise would, but the fact of the process having been thought<lb/>
advisable shows that the sample was not a very high class one originally.<lb/>
" Clipping " may be detected both by the appearance of the altered oat,<lb/>
which has a square-cut end, and by plunging the hand some depth into<lb/>
the sack, when large quantities of the removed beards will be found<lb/>
adhering to it on removal.<lb/>
Foxy oats. Foxy Oats, â When oats are stored in large quantities before they<lb/>
are sufficiently dried, notably for instance in grain ships, they become<lb/>
"heated," in some cases to such an extent as to be actually steaming ;<lb/>
at the same time their colour alters to a deeper yellow than before and<lb/>
they acquire a peculiar acrid smell. Such oats are termed foxy. This<lb/>
defect, like all others, may vary considerably in degree, but when it exists<lb/>
to any extent, particularly in newly imported shipments, it is readily<lb/>
detected.<lb/>
Kiln dried Kiln Dried Oats.â Kiln drying in itself is not a defect, and if the<lb/>

<p>
m bulk, it does not of course affect their quality, but generally speaking,<lb/>
oats are only kiln dried because they were previously damp or foxy,<lb/>
and the fact that the process has been carried out is generally therefore<lb/>
an indication of damaged quality. Kiln drying gets rid of the foxy<lb/>
odour, restores the hardness, but further deepens the colour, so that<lb/>

quite brown from the kiln drying, while others again may be so

Mustiness a?td Mouldiness.âV&amp;gt;oi\\i\-\ese conditions are the result in Mustiness<lb/>

harvest or accidentally after storing. When the growth of the mould is mouldi-<lb/>
so great as to be noticeable a simple inspection is sufficient to detect it, "^^^*<lb/>
but the defect can be detected by the musty smell before it becomes<lb/>
visible, and the condition is frequently accompanied by a soft and spongy<lb/>
feel, varying with the Smount of damp present.

Sprouting Oats are those which have already germinated, and in Sprouting<lb/>

as to render them unfit for consumption under ordinary circumstances,<lb/>
and unlikely to be tendered for sale.
</p>

<p>
Rat-tainted Oats. â The presence of large numbers of rats in a barn Rat-<lb/>
will sometimes cause the grain to become so tainted that horses will tainted<lb/>
refuse it. The condition may be detected by the presence of nibbled oats oats,<lb/>
and the characteristic odour and droppings of the animals.
</p>

<p>
Dirty Oats. â In many foreign samples of oats which are threshed in Dirty oats,<lb/>
the open field a certain quantity of earth and small stones may be found,<lb/>
and in addition such samples may contain small nails with flat heads,<lb/>
which are used for the purpose of tacking canvas to the ship's side to<lb/>
protect the cargo during the voyage. The screening of foreign oats in<lb/>
order to clear them of all such particles is a matter, therefore, which<lb/>
should receive close attention, as their inclusion is likely to produce<lb/>
digestive troubles.
</p>

<p>
Measures by which Oats are sold.â \x\. bulk, oats are sold by the Measures<lb/>
quirter of 304 and 320 pounds according to their quality ; these weights by which<lb/>
are known as "trade weights " and are merely approximate, denoting the ^^'^'^ ^'"^<lb/>
comparatively good or poor quality of the sample. In smaller quantities ^Â°^^'<lb/>
they are dealt in by the bushel, or, when purchased by weight, at so<lb/>
much per 40 lbs., which is generally accepted as a fair trade weight for<lb/>
a bushel of good oats. A "quartern" = a quarter of a gallon, or quart,<lb/>
4 gallons = a bushel, 4 bushels = a sack, 2 sacks = a quarter.

<p>
ANIMAL xMANAGEMENT.
</p>

<p>
Feeding Oats.
</p>

<p>
Oats are the easiest grain to feed to horses ; they thrive on them<lb/>
in the best possible manner, and are able to consume and digest a<lb/>
larger quantity of them than any other grain, without special prepara-<lb/>
tion, and without their digestion becoming upset. With horses<lb/>
Amount to in strong work the amount which they may be given is practically as<lb/>
be given, much as the animal cares to consume, and provided that a suitable<lb/>
quantity of other forage is included in the ration, this will usually vary<lb/>
from 12 to 16 lbs. per day. For animals in moderate work an average of<lb/>
10 lbs. per day suffices, and working horses when rested for a length of<lb/>
time may be given 4 to 6 lbs. daily. Whilst oats may be given whole it<lb/>
Advantage is a decided advantage to have them bruised previously, not because the<lb/>
of crush- horse is unable to grind them with his teeth, but to ensure that the husk<lb/>
ing oats, of each individual grain is split so that any which do escape mastication<lb/>
may be readily acted upon by the gastric and other fluids during the<lb/>
process of digestion. Animals which eat hurriedly, either from natural<lb/>
greediness or for fear that their neighbours may rob them, are naturally<lb/>
inclined to swallow their grain ration without due mastication, and<lb/>
especially is this the case in large bodies of horses fed in open stables.<lb/>
How to The grain should not be crushed flat, but merely have the husk split ; it<lb/>
crush. is indeed a fault to crush it too nmch, as the cont:\ined flour may be
</p>

<p>
thereby lost. Crushing is especially useful with the small, hard, foreign<lb/>
varieties, which are even more liable to be swallowed whole than the<lb/>
Steamed larger, plumper, and somewhat softer British oats. Oats can be steamed<lb/>
oats. or boiled, but as a general rule this is not to be advocated, such methods
</p>

<p>
being usually more suitable to the needs of the hospital than the troop<lb/>
stable.
</p>

<p>
Maize.
</p>

<p>
'Mealies." Known as " mealies" in South Africa, and in most parts of North and<lb/>
South America as " corn," maize is in those countries the staple horse<lb/>
grain. It is used, though not extensively, in India, and its introduction<lb/>
into this country is of comparatively recent date. Containing as it does<lb/>
a very small percentage of mineral sorts, it is admittedly, even where it is<lb/>
in general use, an unsuitable food for the rearing of young stock ; but<lb/>
experience has thoroughly proved that it produces excellent results in all<lb/>
classes of working horses when it is judiciously fed.

FOODS AND FEEDING. 95
</p>

<p>
Characteristics of Maize.
</p>

<p>
It should be perfectly dry, of bright colour, not at all brown,' quite<lb/>
hard, and free from dirt ; when bitten it should taste sweet and<lb/>
have no distinct smell. Maize is bought by the quarter, and should<lb/>
weigh 60 lbs. to the bushel.
</p>

<p>
Varieties.
</p>

<p>
There are three chief varieties, North American, South American, Flat or<lb/>
and small round. North American maize, also known as "flat" or " horse-<lb/>
" horse tooth," is large, flat and roughly triangular, and is the variety tooth ^<lb/>
most appreciated as a horse food in England. In colour the grains of a '^^'"^^ 3"<lb/>
single sample may vary very considerably, ranging from a deep red to<lb/>
practically colourless seeds. South American maize, imported chiefly<lb/>
from the River Plate, and sometimes called "Plate Maize," is of a "Plate"<lb/>
brilliant yellow colour, which is fairly uniform in the sample ; it is flat maize,<lb/>
but is rounder in outline and not so large as the previously mentioned<lb/>
variety. Small round maize is grown in many countries, and varies in<lb/>
shade from bright yellow to colourless, though the colour of any<lb/>
particular sample should be uniform ; its feeding value is considered<lb/>
slightly inferior to the other sorts.
</p>

<p>
Defects<lb/>
Maize travels very badly in bulk once it is shelled from the cob, and Heated<lb/>
is extremely liable to get "heated " during the voyage unless it starts in maize,<lb/>
the most perfect condition. The individual grains then become darker in<lb/>
colour, softer to the feel, and acquire a peculiarly pungent odour, while<lb/>
in recent samples an increase of their temperature may be actually felt.<lb/>
It may also suffer from mustiness or mouldiness, and in all cases where<lb/>
the quality is under suspicion the points of the seeds should be closely<lb/>
examined, as this is the spot where damage is most easily detected.
</p>

<p>
Feeding Maize.
</p>

<p>
Where its use is general and it is fed as the entire grain ration. How to<lb/>
it is often customary to give it on the cob or stalk, and this is feed maize<lb/>
said to increase its feeding value and digestibility. If horses are<lb/>
accustomed to it they may and do consume it whole without ill effects,<lb/>
but whenever possible it should be crushed, as it is hard, difiicult to<lb/>
masticate and takes a comparatively long time to digest. However it is<lb/>
given, it is important to bear in mind that owing to this slowness of<lb/>
digestion animals should not be watered until a considerable time has

elapsed after feeding. When it is impossible to crush and the animal is<lb/>
unaccustomed to it the grain may be soaked until it is soft or preferably<lb/>
boiled. It is not however advisable, at any rate in a temperate climate,<lb/>
to feed horses required for fast work on cooked rations, although<lb/>
this means of preparation may be occasionally taken advantage of to<lb/>
tempt the appetite of the delicate feeder and such as may be suffering<lb/>
from overwork or are convalescent from disease. In England maize is<lb/>
usually and most advantageously fed in mixtures which contain varying<lb/>
proportions of oats and beans or peas in addition, but some large horse-<lb/>
owning companies feed on maize only and find it satisfactory. The<lb/>
admixture of chaff" is particularly called for in such rations owing to the<lb/>
paramount necessity for thorough mastication.

<p>
some, the entire grain ration.
</p>

<p>
Characteristics of Barley.
</p>

<p>
The grain should be plump and short, quite hard, with a thin wrinkled<lb/>
skin and small fine but not shrunken ends ; its colour should generally be<lb/>
a pale golden and it should be free from any distinctive odour. Specimens<lb/>
grown in hot countries are generally somewhat smaller than those from<lb/>
temperate climates. Barley is sold by the quarter and should weigh about<lb/>
54 pounds per bushel.
</p>

<p>
Feeding Barley.
</p>

<p>
In the East this grain is a very general horse food and is some-<lb/>
times given without crushing or other preparation, in which state,<lb/>
however, the toughness and indigestibility of its husk is such, that it<lb/>
can only be consumed with impunity by animals native to the country<lb/>
and not always even by them. For all others it must be prepared by<lb/>
crushing, parching or boiling, or it rapidly gives rise to indigestion and<lb/>
colic. When suitably prepared, however, it may be fed as a whole ration<lb/>
if necessary, and it forms a large proportion of the Service issues in the<lb/>
Mediterranean, north of India, China, Egypt and other eastern stations.

is commonly used in India, has to be employed for this purpose an extra<lb/>

its power.
</p>

<p>
Pa.rchi}ig Barley. â This is a very favourite method of preparation Parching<lb/>
wherever barley is fed. When properly carried out the result is that the barley,<lb/>
husk is just split and the contents become softer and of a floury consistence.<lb/>
The method usually adopted is as follows â a small quantity of sand is made,<lb/>
and kept, almost red hot on the fire, a little of this and a handful of barley<lb/>
are thrown together in a flat pan which is also kept hot and the two are<lb/>
stirred together until it is seen that each individual grain shows a white<lb/>
line down its centre where the husk is split ; sand and grain are then<lb/>
transferred to a small sieve through which the sand runs and is placed in<lb/>
another receptacle to be re-heated. The grain may subsequently be<lb/>
ground if desired, but unless the means are to hand it will be found<lb/>
perfectly digestible without this being done.

inferior to oats, and in countries where it is fed as a general ration it is horse<lb/>
stated to be given coarsely ground or cooked and mixed with chaff. In foo&amp;lt;i-<lb/>
large quantities it is said to cause diarrhoea, and it rapidly ferments<lb/>
and becomes unfit for food if allowed to stand long after cooking.<lb/>

<p>
Although in England wheat is looked upon as a most unsuitable food<lb/>
for horses, it is undoubted that at any rate part of this prejudice is due to<lb/>
want of experience in its use, owing to its value as a food for ourselves ;<lb/>
because it can be fed to animals without exciting those alarming<lb/>
symptoms generally supposed to be produced by it, and especially should<lb/>
this be borne in mind on service when it may be necessary to turn every<lb/>
possible eatable thing to account. It is stated to have been given whole<lb/>
up to 7| pounds daily without ill effects ; flour {attd) is constantly given<lb/>
in India as a nourishing food to animals which are underg-oing severe<lb/>
exertion ; and damaged flour as a supplementary horse food has been<lb/>
used with advantage on service on more than one occasion. It is essential<lb/>
that the grain should be quite dry as it is otherwise extremely indigestible ;<lb/>
it should if possible be crushed or parched and mixed with some other<lb/>
forage in order to ensure thorough mastication. It is only mentioned<lb/>
here as an emergency ration to be utilised when no other offers, or to<lb/>
supplement short supplies.
</p>

<p>
Bran.
</p>

<p>
The quality of bran as a food depends almost entirely on the amount<lb/>
of flour it contains. In countries where milling is scientifically carried<lb/>
out this is of course reduced to a minimum, and its value as a nourishing<lb/>
food is correspondingly reduced ; in England therefore as an article of<lb/>
horse diet it is generally given in order to make the animal chew his<lb/>
food thoroughly, to add bulk or to regulate the bowels, and as a bran<lb/>
mash it is a pretty constant item of the Saturday night ration. Two<lb/>
varieties are distinguished as "broad" or "fine"; in "broad" bran<lb/>
the wheat husk is more or less whole and gives the article a flaky<lb/>
appearance. Another distinction frequently made is between " London "<lb/>
and " Country," the latter containing perhaps rather more flour and<lb/>
being slightly superior. Where bran is produced by hand it necessarily<lb/>
contains a much larger proportion of flour than is the case with the<lb/>
machine-made product, and hence its feeding quality is very much

<p>
enhanced, indeed to such an extent is this the case that in India it is<lb/>
often found possible to keep animals in sufficiently good condition while<lb/>
they are doing exercise with little or no addition to this food.
</p>

<p>
Characteristics of Bran.
</p>

<p>
Good bran should be quite dry, and sweet, flaky, free from lumps, and How to<lb/>
varying slightly in colour according to the wheat from which it is obtained, judge,<lb/>
some samples being redder than others. When chewed it should not<lb/>
taste sour or gritty, and when the hand is plunged into it, it should be<lb/>
perceptibly covered with flour on withdrawal.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally adulteration with sand, barley or rice hulls may be Adultera-<lb/>
detected, the first by throwing a sample into water when it will sink, and tions, how<lb/>
also by chewing a small quantity, and the two latter by close inspection of ^^ detect,<lb/>
the individual flakes, when the roughness of the barley or rice husks will<lb/>
be observed. When bran is hand-made on an earthy floor it is difficult<lb/>
to avoid some sandy particles.
</p>

<p>
Under the influence of damp bran rapidly becomes sour and lumpy. Sour bran,<lb/>
and this is the most common defect to be looked for in English samples.
</p>

<p>
Feediitg Bran. â As previously stated bran can only be regarded as a Feeding<lb/>
work-producing food if it contains a good proportion of flour, and this is bran,<lb/>
not to be looked for at home â it is however valuable as an adjunct to the<lb/>
grain ration (i) in order to ensure mastication ; (2) to increase bulk ; (3) to<lb/>
mix with very heating foods, and so enable the digestion to cope with them<lb/>
without being upset. Given as a mash it is generally supposed to be a<lb/>
slight laxative and to produce the opposite efl'ect when dry. A bran mash Bran<lb/>
should be made by scalding about 2 to 3 pounds of bran in a bucket with mash,<lb/>
boiling water, it should then be covered and allowed to stand until cool<lb/>
enough to eat ; the addition of a little salt makes it palatable.
</p>

<p>
Beans and Peas.
</p>

<p>
These grains are by far the most nutritious of any given to " Heat-<lb/>
animals, containing as they do an exceedingly large proportion of flesh- ing" food,<lb/>
forming elements ; but owing to this fact they are very " heating " foods,<lb/>
which cannot be given in large quantities under any circumstances,<lb/>
and are not advisable at all unless the animals receiving them are<lb/>
performing a considerable amount of hard work or undergoing exposure.
</p>

<p>
Characteristics.<lb/>
Beans should be hard and dry, sweet to taste, light brown in colour. Appear-<lb/>
and free from weevil ; they should weigh about 64 pounds a bushel, ^nces.<lb/>

<p>
"Java"<lb/>
beans.
</p>

<p>
Peas should also be dry, sound and free from weevil, not a dark colour,<lb/>
and the same weight. Varieties of peas are distinguished as blue, white<lb/>
or grey, according to their colour.
</p>

<p>
yar/e/ies.â English beans are smaller, rounder, and plumper than<lb/>
imported sorts ; their skins, however, are thinner, and their quality,<lb/>
when in good condition, the best. Imported beans, especially Egyptians,<lb/>
are larger, flatter, and more wrinkled, whilst their skins are tougher and<lb/>
thicker. "Java" beans, imported from Ceylon, Burmah, and the Dutch<lb/>
Indies are quite unfit for consumption, owing to their poisonous qualities.
</p>

<p>
Defects,
</p>

<p>
New beans are indigestible and they should not be used until they are<lb/>
a year old ; with increasing age, however, they depreciate in condition,<lb/>
are extremely liable to become invaded by weevils and (English beans<lb/>
especially), darker in colour. Peas are likely to suffer from wet either<lb/>
during the harvest or when stacked, when their colour becomes black.
</p>

<p>
Feeding Beans. â As previously remarked, beans and peas are alto-<lb/>
gether too nutritious to be fed in very large quantities and the amount<lb/>
which it is advisable to give in addition to other forage is probably not<lb/>
more than four or five pounds at the outside, and this only to big horses<lb/>
Split beans that are doing severe work. They should always be split on account of<lb/>
an peas. ^^ extreme toughness of tKeir husks, but fine grinding is not to<lb/>

<p>
Linseed.
</p>

<p>
Is often used as an addition to the ration of thin horses, its<lb/>
characteristic being that it contains an exceedingly large proportion<lb/>
of fat-forming material. Linseed cakes, which are so commonly given to<lb/>
cattle, and sometimes horses, and are well known for their fattening<lb/>
properties, are composed of the residue of linseed from which the oil<lb/>
(linseed oil) has already been expressed.
</p>

<p>
Quality. â The best linseed may not always be the largest in appear-<lb/>
ance ; the grains should be plump and well filled rather than large and<lb/>
flat. All samples should be bright in appearance and free from dirt.<lb/>
English grown linseed is usually of the best quality, but large quantities<lb/>
of excellent value are imported from Holland, Russia, and Morocco.
</p>

<p>
Feeding Linseed. â Owing to the extreme toughness of the husk<lb/>
animals cannot consume linseed in its natural state, and it must be either<lb/>
ground or boiled ; even when so prepared the indigestibility of the husk<lb/>
is such that it passes through the body unchanged. When boiled,

<p>
linseed should be cooked quite slowly and repeatedly stirred to prevent Boiled<lb/>
it sticking to the side of the vessel and burning ; if time is not an object, a linseed,<lb/>
long continued period of soaking (24 hours) will answer the same purpose.<lb/>
When thoroughly cooked or soaked the result is a jelly-like material of<lb/>
the consistence of starch, and in this condition it is readily eaten and is<lb/>
an excellent addition to any ration for the purpose of fattening the<lb/>
animal. Half a pound to one pound daily is usually a sufficient Quantity,<lb/>
quantity for this purpose, and the water in which the grain has been<lb/>
cooked (linseed tea), should be added to the ration as it is very nutritious. Linseed

<p>
Linseed cake, which is compressed refuse linseed after the oil has ^^.^â¢<lb/>
been extracted, may be given as part of a mixed ration and should ^^"seed<lb/>
be broken up into small pieces before being placed in the manger ; Lif^seg^j<lb/>
linseed oil added to the food is, however, although frequently given, not oil.<lb/>
so suitable or nourishing a method as giving the actual grain or cake,<lb/>
because the digestion does not so readily absorb it in this form.
</p>

<p>
GRAM.
</p>

<p>
Gram (Chenna), a variety of pea, is the chief grain used in Western "Chenna.<lb/>
and Northern India ; as a general ration it contains much too large a<lb/>
proportion of flesh-formers to be suitable for an unlimited ration, and<lb/>
ten pounds is generally said to be the most which can be given daily<lb/>
with advantage. In appearance it is a reddish or yellowish brown, rather Appear-<lb/>
shrivelled pea, roughly pyramidal in shape ; the outer skin is very hard ance.<lb/>
and when split the kernel is a bright yellow colour, tasting very much<lb/>
like ordinary peas. Inferior quaHties are small, much shrivelled, Inferior<lb/>
greenish or almost black in colour and sometimes bitter to the taste, qualities.<lb/>
As the grain is harvested in the open field small quantities of sand and<lb/>
stones may be found in a sample and it requires carefully cleaning before<lb/>
being fit for use ; it is frequently adulterated by the addition of a pro-<lb/>
portion of cheaper grain and this practice is so prevalent that it is Two<lb/>
customary to distinguish two qualities, viz., first and second sort, the official<lb/>
latter of which is acknowledged to contain five per cent, inferior grains, qualities.<lb/>
As the grain increases in age it tends to become darker and is very liable<lb/>
to the attacks of vv^eevils ; it should be kept for at least four months after Weevils<lb/>
being harvested before it is really fit for issue. The presence of in gram.<lb/>
Lathyrus seeds in gram should always be looked for (see Lathyrus, p. 103).
</p>

<p>
Feeding Grujn. â Although it may occasionally be necessary . to Feeding<lb/>

this should be avoided if possible ; the general method of feeding is to

Various other Foods.

Potatoes are utilised for horses in Ireland and parts of England. Potatoes.<lb/>

<p>
Raw sugar cannot be given in large quantities without disturbing the<lb/>
digestion, but as sugar cane, treacle, or crystal sugar it can be added to<lb/>
the food in sufficient amount.
</p>

<p>
Sugar as a food is said to be both sustaining and fattening, and<lb/>
especially useful during exposure to cold and hardship ; as an addition to<lb/>
otherwise insufficient rations, it may be of use under these conditions.

Gruel and Similar Preparations.

<p>
Gruel is made either by pouring boiling water on oatmeal and letting Oatmeal<lb/>
it cool, or by simply stirring up a couple of handfuls of oatmeal in a bucket gruel,<lb/>
of cold or chilled water. In either case it should not contain sufficient<lb/>
oatmeal to make it at all thick, and both are readily swallowed and<lb/>
enjoyed. In England oatmeal gruel is very constantly given to horses<lb/>
after long, tiring work as a refresher on the way home, and is an excellent<lb/>
method of sustaining them. Similar preparations may be made from Various<lb/>
other grains {e.g., maize meal or bean meal), and are all useful on gruels.

Hay.

<p>
Hay consists of dried grass and other plants which have been allowed<lb/>
to mature in a stack. Those plants which are not true grasses are spoken<lb/>
of of as " herbage." It was formerly the custom to speak of hay as " upland,"<lb/>
"lowland" and "water meadow," and before the introduction of modern<lb/>
methods of drainage and farming it was possible to say from an inspection<lb/>
of the sample to which of these three classes it belonged ; at the present<lb/>
time, however, when adequate drainage has made such great improvement<lb/>
in many lowlands the terms will hardly apply except as regards water<lb/>
meadow hay which may be recognised by the presence of water grasses,<lb/>
sedges and rushes and by its generally coarser growth. Hay is now<lb/>
produced either on land which is, and has been for a very long time laid<lb/>
down for this particular purpose, when it is spoken of as " meadow hay " ; or<lb/>
from seed sown as a rotation crop which according to the number of years it<lb/>

<p>
Meadow Hay grown on permanent grass land, can be distinguished Meadow<lb/>
by the large variety of grasses, the fineness of the growth and generally "^y-<lb/>
by the superior aroma.
</p>

<p>
Seed Hay is characterised by the small variety of the contained Seed hay.<lb/>
grasses, the great vigour of their growth, its general hardness as<lb/>
compared with meadow hay, and very often by the large proportion of<lb/>
clover and other herbage it contains.
</p>

<p>
Hay making.â Yi2iy is cut by the farmer at two distinct periods of its Period ot<lb/>
growth v/ith different ends in view ; first, if he desires to afford his land cutting,<lb/>
some help from the seed, he cuts it late, so that, in the making, a good<lb/>
proportion of the already well formed seed will fall out and be restored ;<lb/>
second, if he wishes to produce the finest possible quality of hay or has<lb/>
the intention of getting a second crop, he cuts earlier when the majority of<lb/>
the grasses are in full bloom or just after the flower has disappeared.<lb/>
From the purchaser's point of view the latter of course is by far preferable,<lb/>
and in judging samples close attention should be given to the period at Early cut<lb/>
which the crop appears to have been cut. As soon as seed has formed best,<lb/>
the stems of the plants get woody and are less nutritious when made into<lb/>
hay than they would have been during late flowering.
</p>

<p>
The processes of drying, carrying and stacking are all included under * * Saving "<lb/>
the term " saving." Well saved hay has been dried rapidly without being ^^y*<lb/>
wetted by rain, and is therefore of a much better colour and less touzled<lb/>
than any which has been weathered, i.e.^ rained upon, left lying upon the Action of<lb/>
ground, and subsequently much tossed to dry it. Rain is particularly rain on<lb/>
injurious to hay because it dissolves out of the cut stalks a proportion of "^^y-<lb/>
those nutritious properties which give it such a high feeding value. The Weight ot<lb/>
comparative greenness of well-saved hay, even when it is old, cannot fail crop,<lb/>
to distinguish it from other samples which have been stacked under less<lb/>
fortunate conditions. Meadow hay, being generally a lighter crop and<lb/>
more easily dried than " mixtures " containing a large proportion of<lb/>
heavy succulent clovers and other herbage, is generally easier to save.
</p>

<p>
After cutting, the grass is turned or tossed to ensure drying, then<lb/>
raked into " windrows " and afterwards " cocked " or " coiled " previous<lb/>
to stacking.
</p>

<p>
In Ireland, Scotland, and the north, the haycocks are made gradually Various<lb/>
larger as the hay dries till they assume a considerable size and in Ireland ways of<lb/>
they are often left in the fields in that condition. In the Midlands and saving,<lb/>
south, the hay is carried as soon as possible â the difference in method<lb/>
being due to climatic conditions.

ANIMAL MANAGEMENT.
</p>

<p>
The Chief Grasses and Plants of English Hay. (See plates.)
</p>

<p>
Useful grasses. â The Meadow grasses {poas). These are widely<lb/>
distributed grasses of which four varieties, the " Smoothed stalked<lb/>
meadow grass," the " Rough stalked meadow grass " the " Evergreen<lb/>
meadow grass," and " Annual meadow grass," are commonly found in<lb/>
meadow hay. They do not grow to any great size, but they produce a<lb/>
good bottom, and both the rough and smooth-stalked varieties especially<lb/>
have highly nutritive properties, all animals exhibiting a marked partiality<lb/>
for them. The flowering head of grasses of this class is somewhat<lb/>
difficult to distinguish from the fescues, and the distinction can only be<lb/>
made by practice, but as both are excellent it is not very important.<lb/>
The famous " blue grass " of Kentucky is the smooth-stalked meadow grass.
</p>

<p>
The " Fescues,^' another large class, have several varieties which are<lb/>
frequently met with, the " Meadow " and the " Tali " being constantly,<lb/>
and " Hard " and the " Sheep's fescue" occasionally seen. These latter<lb/>
are chiefly found on good upland pastures used for sheep grazing and<lb/>
though fine and small are very nutritious. The Hard Fescue is one of the<lb/>
best pasture grasses, eaten with relish by all stock and though not very<lb/>
large is of superior quality and value. It takes its name from the crisp<lb/>
feel of the spikelets when the flowering head is ripe.
</p>

<p>
The " Meadow Fescue " is of moderate size but most nutritious and<lb/>
productive, is readily eaten by all stock, and may be regarded as one of<lb/>
the most valuable grasses the country produces.
</p>

<p>
The "Tall Fescue," a much larger grass, is not so highly esteemed,<lb/>
but is nevertheless a distinctly good variety. Other varieties are the<lb/>
" Fine," " Various leaved" and " Red fescues."
</p>

<p>
" Meadow Fox tail," so called from its distinct resemblance to a " brush,"<lb/>
produces a large quantity of herbage in proportion to its stalk, which<lb/>
makes it an excellent hay and pasture grass, and is also very hardy,<lb/>
growing well under trees ; it is easily distinguished by its very characteristic<lb/>
flowering head.
</p>

<p>
"Meadow Cat's tail" or "Timothy" grass, named after its importer,<lb/>
Mr. Timothy Hanson. In its native country (America) crops of this grass<lb/>
may attain a height of 6 feet, but here it is not nearly so tall ; it is ex-<lb/>
tremely hardy, flourishing best on a damp, cool soil, but apt to get woody<lb/>
if cut late ; an excellent hay grass. Its flowering head may be distinguished<lb/>
from the Fox tail by its comparative hardness and bristle-like feel and<lb/>
by the absence of the short fine hairs which cover the latter.
</p>

<p>
" Crested Dog's tail " is a pasture rather than a hay grass, its herbage<lb/>
not being very bulky, but it is nevertheless very nutritious and a notable

feature of many of our sheep downs, where, with the Hard and Sheep's<lb/>
fescues it is responsible for a great deal of the grazing. The serrated<lb/>
appearance of its flowering head cannot fail to distinguish it from other<lb/>
varieties.
</p>

<p>
" Rye Grasses."â Of the many known varieties of Rye grasses two are Rye<lb/>
chiefly found in hay, the Perennial and Italian. Rye grasses may be grasses,<lb/>
distinguished by the flattened appearance of the flowering head, the<lb/>
spikelets of which stick out alternately from each side of the stalk, the<lb/>
whole grass looking as if it had been pressed flat ; they may be cut<lb/>
comparatively later than others owing to the fact that they do not<lb/>
deteriorate so rapidly after flowering. Perennial Rye grass is smaller<lb/>
than the Italian variety, from which it may also be distinguished by the<lb/>
long hairy awns of the latter. Itahan Rye grass is a biennial plant, much<lb/>
larger than the perennial variety, producing enormous yields, particularly<lb/>
on sewage farms, where it is grown for use as a green crop ; both are<lb/>
excellent feeding grasses.
</p>

<p>
"Yellow Oat grass," so named from the golden appearance of its Oat<lb/>
flowering head, is a valuable hay grass which flourishes particularly in grasses,<lb/>
the South of England and the Thames Valley.
</p>

<p>
" The Tall Oat grass," a much larger variety than the last mentioned,<lb/>
has rather a bitter flavour, and is in consequence not so well regarded in<lb/>
this country ; but on the continent and especially in Sweden, where it is<lb/>
abundantly cultivated, it is very highly esteemed. The oat grasses may<lb/>
be recognised by their general resemblance in appearance to oats, though<lb/>
much smaller.
</p>

<p>
" Cock's Foot," known in America as Orchard Grass, from the fact that Cock's<lb/>
it flourishes beneath trees, is a rough, tall grass with a very distinctive foot,<lb/>
flowering head ; it grows in large tufts, and is liable to become extremely<lb/>
coarse if not cut sufficiently soon ; it is, however, an excellent grass and<lb/>
liked by horses.
</p>

<p>
" Fiorin," one of a family commonly known as Bents, is constantly found Fiorin.<lb/>
in hay, but does not appear to be of very great feeding value ; the "Bents,<lb/>
colour of the flowering heads varies from white to purple and they are<lb/>
characterised by their hairlike fineness.
</p>

<p>
" Sweet Vernal " is a grass of excellent quality though only of medium Sweet<lb/>
size and not producing a great quantity of herbage ; it has, however, such an Vernal,<lb/>
extremely pleasant aroma and is so much relished by all animals that it is<lb/>
a universal favourite ; it grows very abundantly in Devonshire and also<lb/>
in the Eastern counties. It is to this grass that the aroma of hay is<lb/>
chiefly due.

<p>
The " Barren Fescue " is a weed grass easily distinguished from other<lb/>
Fescues by the very long awns of the spikelets ; it is found in poor and<lb/>
sandy soil.
</p>

<p>
" Couch grass" or "Twitch" may on casual inspection be mistaken for<lb/>
Rye grass, but if looked at carefully it will be seen that the spikelets grow<lb/>
from all sides of the stem and not from opposite sides only, nor has it the<lb/>
crushed flat appearance so characteristic of rye grass ; it is chiefly found<lb/>
on arable land and not as a rule in meadow hay since it disappears from<lb/>
old pastures. " Bearded wheat grass " closely resembles couch grass<lb/>
in appearance.
</p>

<p>
" Darnel " is another grass which may be mistaken for rye grass, from<lb/>
which however it is easily distinguished by the fact that the outside sheath<lb/>
of each spikelet is longer than the spikelet itself; it is not only useless but<lb/>
in large quantities poisonous. The small quantity found in hay has<lb/>
never been found to cause any symptom.
</p>

<p>
"The Slender Fox Tail," or "hunger weed," is also a weed on arable<lb/>
land which may be found in artificial but rarely in meadow hay ; it<lb/>
generally resembles the meadow fox tail except that its flowering head is<lb/>
miuch more slender and is darkly spotted, from which cause it is called<lb/>
" black twitch " in the Midlands. Another worthless variety is the<lb/>
" Floating Fox Tail."
</p>

<p>
" Soft Brome " is a worthless grass in hay, because it seeds so very early<lb/>
that when the crop is cut its herbage is all shrivelled and the stem woody ;<lb/>
in appearance it is not liable to be mistaken for any other grass, and the<lb/>
spikelets have a peculiar elastic soft feel which further distinguishes<lb/>
them. " Upright Brome " is equally valueless. The " Barren Brome "<lb/>
has long awns to the spikelet and is quite useless.
</p>

<p>
"Tufted Hair grass" or " Tussock grass," found in low-lying meadows,<lb/>
has a tall, handsome, waving head, the spikelets of which are a lustrous<lb/>
brown colour. " Wavy hair grass " is a smaller but similar variety found in<lb/>
woods and on sandy soil ; both are equally worthless in hay.
</p>

<p>
" Quaking grass " also found on heaths and sandy soils is valueless, and<lb/>
its constantly shivering spikelets, which are also a quite distinctive shape,<lb/>
make it unmistakable.
</p>

<p>
" Yorkshire Fog " or " Meadow soft grass " and a creeping variety called<lb/>
" Creeping soft giass," have flowering heads which are practically alike<lb/>
and equally worthless. Until the flower is quite full the head is enclosed<lb/>
in a sheath ; in colour it varies from white to purple and has a soft,<lb/>
woolly feel and bitter taste which causes it to be avoided by stock.

The " Reed Sweet grass," " Floating sweet grass " and " Reed canary " ^^f^^*<lb/>
or " Ribbon grass," together with Sedges and Rushes, are only found in gj-asses.<lb/>
the neighbourhood of low lying and water meadows ; the two first-<lb/>
mentioned grasses are useful for the feeding of stock, but the locality in<lb/>
which they grow prevents them being classed as good hay grasses.
</p>

<p>
Clovers.
</p>

<p>
"Red Clover." â There are three kinds of red clover, "Broad red clover," Red<lb/>
a biennial plant with a hollow stem and a broadly pointed leaf ; and two clovers,<lb/>
perennial varieties closely resembling each other, which are commonly<lb/>
called " Cow grass," have solid stems and lance-shaped leaves. They are Cowgrass.<lb/>
all large, juicy plants which may be fed green or as hay ; as a hay crop<lb/>
they are difficult to save, but are excellent feeding.
</p>

<p>
"Alsike," originally imported from Sweden and sometimes called Alsike<lb/>
Swedish clover, is often grown instead of the red varieties, as it is not so clover,<lb/>
susceptible to clover sickness, a disease caused by minute worms in the Swedish<lb/>
stem ; this variety, however, only grows well on moist lands, which precludes ^ Â°^^^'<lb/>
its general adoption in many districts.
</p>

<p>
"White" or "Dutch" clover, originally imported from Holland, is a White or<lb/>
smaller plant than the above varieties, and more suitable therefore as Dutch<lb/>
pasture than for hay, but is of excellent quality, and since it is found on clover,<lb/>
all good land is constantly met with in good hay.
</p>

<p>
"Valerian," " Italian" or "Crimson clover," commonly called " Trifo- Valerian,<lb/>
Hum," is an annual plant, grows tall and heavy, has a long brilliant Italian, or<lb/>
crimson flower, and as it comes to maturity very early is not often made crimson<lb/>
into hay by itself, although in combination with early grasses it is found y^foJium.<lb/>
in some mixtures. Owing to the heaviness of the crop it is difficult to<lb/>
save well except in very good weather, and becomes coarse and woody<lb/>
unless cut young : it makes excellent green food.
</p>

<p>
Three other small clovers may be found, viz. : â

suitable soils and under irrigation it is practically perennial, grows most<lb/>
luxuriously, and is especially useful as a green food owing to the many<lb/>
cuttings which can be made from it. In America, where its culture has<lb/>
received much attention, it bears the highest reputation both when used<lb/>
in this manner and when made into hay, and though as hay it is found to<lb/>
be extremely brittle and dusty, and in this country is considered wasteful,<lb/>
its feeding properties can hardly be over-estimated. As it roots very<lb/>
deeply on suitable soils it is most useful for dry localities, and is<lb/>
cultivated with much care by horse-owners in India, where its value as a

much relished by animals and is very nutritious. There are two varieties.<lb/>
" common " and " giant " or " double cut," the latter of which is more<lb/>
productive, and yields twice a year, but is only biennial. In judging<lb/>
sainfoin hay the extreme thickness of the stalks, provided they are not<lb/>
tough, is not considered a drawback, and as it is easier to save than other<lb/>
heavy crops it is generally in good condition. The best sainfoin hay is<lb/>
cut before the plant comes into flower.

plants found in it should be recognisable by their form and not too<lb/>
brittle and dusty. On opening a truss, the fibres of the stalks should not<lb/>
be much tangled, but should lie more or less in parallel bundles, showing<lb/>
that it has not been necessary to unduly toss the crop while being made,<lb/>
though this characteristic is not so much marked in hay that has been<lb/>

FOODS AND FEEDING. II3
</p>

<p>
Dust. â Old samples may be somewhat dusty, dust in hay being an Dust,<lb/>
invariable accompaniment of age ; it is increased by the crop having<lb/>
been cut too late and so being extra dry, by unduly long exposure to<lb/>
the sun, or by the hei-bage having been rendered brittle as the result of<lb/>
being weathered during making ; and whilst good old hay is invariably<lb/>
slightly dusty, it may be taken that very dusty samples have originally<lb/>
suftered from one of the above causes.
</p>

<p>
Colour. â The colour of hay may vary from greenish to light brown. Colour,<lb/>
but it should not be yellow or dark brown, nor should the stems of the<lb/>
grasses be spotted by blight. Meadow hay is generally of a greener<lb/>
tint than artificial mixtures, since it is usually a lighter crop composed of<lb/>
finer, quicker drying plants, and therefore easier to save. Colour lasts<lb/>
longest in flowering heads and grass stems, and fades quickest in broad<lb/>
succulent leaves of various kinds of herbage and some weeds ; it dis-<lb/>
appears slowly with age, but should be fairly preserved at one year ;<lb/>
rain washes it out very rapidly, and a heavy shower may convert a crop<lb/>
from green to pale brow^n.
</p>

<p>
Mowbumt Hay. â If carried before the juicy stems of the grasses are Mowburnt<lb/>
sufficiently dried up, the subsequent fermentation (" heating ") in the ^^y-<lb/>
stack produces such great heat, especially towards the centre, that the hay<lb/>
m.ay be charred, or the rick may even catch fire. When the condition is,<lb/>
however, very slightly marked, it merely imparts a brown tinge to the<lb/>
sample, which also acquires a svv'cet and somewhat pungent smell, both<lb/>
conditions being in proportion to the extent of the heating. In very<lb/>
slight degree it is no drawback to the quality, and is, as a matter of<lb/>
fact, much relished by horses ; indeed, what w^e should call slightly<lb/>
mowburnt hay is in some parts of Europe made purposely under the Brown<lb/>
name of "brown hay"; but if the condition is at all pronounced it ^^y-<lb/>
becomes unfit for consumption, is often refused by the animal, or if<lb/>
partaken of may induce a simple form of diabetes.
</p>

<p>
Musiy and Mouldy Hay. â Although it may have been quite dry as Musty and<lb/>
regards the juice contained in the grasses, hay which is stacked damp mouldy<lb/>
from rain or subsequently wetted, is likely to turn musty, and if the y*<lb/>
dampness is pronounced, to become mouldy ; musty hay is sometimes a<lb/>
dark brown colour and sometimes a bright yellow, has a characteristic<lb/>
unpleasant odour and a bitter taste, in spite of which, if it is not very<lb/>
badly affected, horses may eat it, though as a food it is naturally inferior<lb/>
in proportion as the condition is marked. When mould is visible it<lb/>
appears as light or white patches here and there in the truss, and the<lb/>
surrounding portions are generally deep brown or black in colour ; it is<lb/>
naturally unfit for fodder. Both mustiness and mouldiness may be found<lb/>

</p>

<p>
Taste. â The taste of good hay is not very marked, being faintly sweet<lb/>
and rather mawkish ; the sweetness is more pronounced in mowburnt<lb/>
samples, and when musty or mouldy it becomes bitter.
</p>

<p>
'"'' Nose.^^ â The aroma of good hay is due to the aromatic grasses con-<lb/>
tained in it, Sweet Vernal being the variety which is mainly responsible.<lb/>
This pleasant characteristic is generally spoken of as the " nose " of the<lb/>
hay, and when in perfection has the well-known smell of a newly-<lb/>
mown field ; it becomes fainter with age, but persists as long as the hay<lb/>
is good. Rain destroys it very rapidly, and in such case absence rather<lb/>
than presence of smell is to be desired, any marked odour being due to<lb/>
the result of damp. Mowburnt hay, as previously noted, acquires when<lb/>
only slightly marked a decidedly sweet and pleasant nose.
</p>

<p>
Disiinctioii betii'een New and Old Hay. â In the trade, hay is termed<lb/>
"old" after Michaelmas Day (29th September), and this practice is<lb/>
followed in contracts ; but, generally speaking, when reference is made to<lb/>
" good old hay," it is understood to be between 6 and 18 months old,<lb/>
before which period it is not at its best as a rule, and after which it<lb/>
deteriorates. In the autumn it is sometimes difficult to decide whether<lb/>
a particular sample is to be classed as new or old. In an early season,<lb/>
when the cut is light and well saved, it will mature quickly, and trusses<lb/>
cut from a heavy stack where they have been subjected to enormous<lb/>
pressure and some heat may have a deceptive appearance of age. The<lb/>
following are the points to be considered in deciding. New hay is softer,<lb/>
wants crispness, carries more colour, tastes sweeter, and has a stronger<lb/>
nose than old. The fibres are not so dry or brittle, contain more moisture,<lb/>
and it consequently cuts out bulkier and heavier in the truss. Thick<lb/>
stems of plants, and the nodes on the stalks of grasses, hold moisture<lb/>
longest, and this may be tested by cutting and biting them. Old hay is<lb/>
crisper to feel, more brittle, has less decided taste and smell, with the<lb/>
colour of the grasses and flower heads more faded and the herbage and<lb/>
weeds blackened. It is more closely packed owing to longer pressure in<lb/>
the stack, and cuts out smaller and more solidly in the truss. When the<lb/>
sample has been slightly mowburnt, the difficulty of deciding is increased,<lb/>
and allowance should also be made for the fact that the finer kinds of<lb/>
hay are more compressible and cut out more solid than the rougher,<lb/>
herbaceous sorts.
</p>

<p>
Clover /lay. â When grown alone as a hay, clover is, owing to its<lb/>
weight and succulence, a difficult crop to save well except under the most<lb/>
favourable conditions, and even then it may waste in the stack to a fifth

of its original weight. It is excellent and palatable feeding, though,<lb/>
owing to its brittleness and consequent dustiness, it is liable to be<lb/>
somewhat wasteful, and is also very prone to be affected by mould.
</p>

<p>
Oat hay is extensively grown in Australia and South Africa, being Oat hay.<lb/>
known in the latter country as "forage." For its production the crop is<lb/>
cut half ripe, whilst the grain is still in milk ; and either long or chaffed,<lb/>
it makes most excellent fodder, being especially a good board ship<lb/>
ration wherever it can be procured.
</p>

<p>
Liicertie hay is rarely made in England, but in Western and Southern Lucerne<lb/>
America, where it is called " Alfalfa," it is extensively produced and is hay.<lb/>
very highly regarded both as a horse and general stock food. In this<lb/>
country it is said to be wasteful owing to its extreme brittleness and<lb/>
dustiness.
</p>

<p>
Sainfoin hay is excellent when cut at a suitable age and well saved. Sainfoin<lb/>
To the uninitiated its coarse woody appearance is deceptive, but although hay.<lb/>
bulky and somewhat rough looking, it makes a very nutritious food,<lb/>
eminently suitable for the larger, heavier classes of horses. .
</p>

<p>
Ti)nothy hay. â A considerable quantity of hay composed entirely of Timothy<lb/>
this grass is imported from Canada and America, where it grows in great ^^Y-<lb/>
luxuriance ; the quality of the imported specimens varies considerably, Canadian,<lb/>
but the best are excellent feed, though very dusty, and it is generally<lb/>
advisable to damp it before issue.
</p>

<p>
Algerian hay is occasionally imported during bad seasons, is of a fair Algerian<lb/>
quality, and like all hay produced in warm, dry climates, is particularly hay.<lb/>
well saved, the colours of the flowers being especially pronounced. It<lb/>
contains a variety of grasses not seen in this country, and frequently a<lb/>
large number of hard thorny seeds, which are rejected by horses.
</p>

<p>
Pressed hay is prepared in bales varying from about 80 to 160 lbs. Pressed<lb/>
each, and is particularly useful on service owing to its portability. Such hay or<lb/>
bales as are prepared in the service are composed of the best quality baled hay.<lb/>
only, but those purchased under contract require strict scrutiny. Even<lb/>
when the greatest care is exercised and the best class of hay only used,<lb/>
the result comes out very broken and dusty, and every care should be Is dusty<lb/>
taken when the bales are being broken up to protect them from the wind, and<lb/>

considerable. ^^'^P^^'

<p>
" Vetches " or " tares " are sown from winter to spring with the<lb/>
object of producing a green food during spring and summer, either<lb/>
alone or with oats or rye, and form the "green meat'"' which is sold in<lb/>
bundles throughout England. They are plants of the pea tribe, with<lb/>
blue, yellow or purple flowers, and should be cut just before they come â <lb/>
into seed.
</p>

<p>
Oats and Rye are sown in England for green food, the former usually<lb/>
with tares and the latter alone ; they should be cut before the head has<lb/>
hardened and while the stem and leaf is quite juicy and tender.
</p>

<p>
Other ce?'eals {ju/ieat, barley) may also be used green, and in India<lb/>
and other countries often are ; in fact almost any green crop may be<lb/>
utilized for feeding animals when necessary, millet and uiaize stalks^ sugar<lb/>
cane^ gui?iea grass^ and bamboo leaves all being useful when obtainable.
</p>

<p>
Furze. â When cut young and well bruised, this is an excellent fodder,<lb/>
and is in use in some parts of Ireland as a general horse fo(jd. It was<lb/>
largely used for the mounted troops during the Peninsular War.
</p>

<p>
Carrots, whether of the red or white type, are greatly appreciated by<lb/>
all horses, and even in the smallest quantities are nmch relished when<lb/>
mixed with the food. When only a pound or two, as is usually the case,<lb/>
can be given each animal, this is by far the best means of feeding them.<lb/>
After being scrubbed, they should be cut into small slices, lengthwise and<lb/>
not across, as the latter method may cause a greedy animal to choke.
</p>

<p>
Feedijig gree?i stuff. â In spring and summer a judicious mixture ot<lb/>
green stuff with the usual ration is advisable for all working horses.<lb/>
It should not be given in large quantities suddenly, especially to<lb/>
horses in work ; but a few pounds daily mixed with the hay and chopped<lb/>
Avith the feed are most appetizing, and assist the digestion by being<lb/>
slightly laxative. In large quantities, green food may produce diarrhoea<lb/>
and even colic, and discretion must always be used in introducing it<lb/>
into the ration. Carrots may be regarded in the same Hght, and they<lb/>
have the advantage of being procurable when green meat is out of<lb/>
season. Wlien feeding entirely on green foods thirty-five to forty<lb/>
pounds is not an excessive amount to give ; but for service horses this is<lb/>
rarely advisable, and about ten pounds may be taken as a maximum<lb/>
addition to the ration.
</p>

<p>
The tendency of horses to gorge themselves on green stuff, if allowed<lb/>
to, must be borne in mind ; and it should not be left in the stable at night<lb/>
in case some animal slips his head collar and finds his way to it.<lb/>
" When sufficient grazing is procurable and feasible, it is always to be<lb/>
preferred to "soiling," i.e.^ feeding green food in the stall.

FOODS AND FEEDING. II7
</p>

<p>
Indian Fodder.
</p>

<p>
Hay, as made in England, is not often met with in India. Instead Indian<lb/>
of being stacked with just sufficient moisture left in the stalks to cause hay.<lb/>
slight fermentation, which renders hay so palatable to animals, it is,<lb/>
owing to climatic conditions, frequently over-dried or badly rain-washed,<lb/>
and so loses in nutritive quality ; moreover, haymaking is rarely under-<lb/>
taken with sufficient care and skill to produce good results, and to this<lb/>
must be attributed the infrequency of its production, for where good<lb/>
grass cultivation has been obtained and sufficient knowledge and<lb/>
foresight been brought to bear on the question, as good hay has been<lb/>
produced as in England, and there is no reason why, in suitable localities,<lb/>
a plentiful supply for troops should not be obtained. Wherever hay Hay<lb/>
feeding has been adopted there has been a marked decrease of outbreaks feeding<lb/>
of anthrax, and for this reason alone enough should be cultivated to decreases<lb/>
form a reserve supply, if not the total ration. disease.
</p>

<p>
In the hills, grass, much of which is excellent feeding when green, is<lb/>
left standing and only cut as required, with the result that for a Hill rass.<lb/>
considerable period animals in these districts are offered bundles of<lb/>
sticks instead of hay.
</p>

<p>
Grasses are of excellent quality and variety ; one or two chiefly used Grasses,<lb/>
for horses are here mentioned ; many good grasses are only suitable for<lb/>
horses when young, as they grow too coarse and woody.
</p>

<p>
Dhfib (North India), Hariala (South India) is a creeping grass with Dhub,<lb/>
an underground stem which throws out tufts of roots at intervals. It is hariala.<lb/>
a splendid feeding grass, very hardy and able to grow with a minimum<lb/>
of moisture. Under favourable conditions it attains a height of eighteen<lb/>
inches, and when cultivated makes the best class of hay. Naturally, it<lb/>
is not so luxuriant in arid districts, but yet grows well, and its succulent<lb/>
stems run freely just below the surface. The native method of cutting How cut.<lb/>
is to pare off the surface of the ground and the grass with it by means<lb/>
of a " Kurpa " or broad trowel ; the dirt is then shaken, beaten, or<lb/>
washed out. Washing, generally in most polluted puddles, to improve Washing<lb/>
the appearance of the bundle, and soaking in the same for hours to grass,<lb/>
increase its weight, are both favourite dodges of the grass cutters and<lb/>
should be strictly prohibited. Forty pounds is considered the correct Amount<lb/>
amount for a grass cutter to bring daily, but in the hot weather twenty-five given,<lb/>
pounds is more frequently the actual amount obtained. Dhub is one<lb/>
of the best forage grasses and may be regarded as the staple horse<lb/>
grass of India.

<p>
Janewa^ a tall grass with its flowering head covered by small,<lb/>
spear-like processes, which, however, are not stiff enough to become<lb/>
a nuisance in mastication. This is an excellent grass, and in some of<lb/>
the western districts is universally consumed, both green and as hay.<lb/>
Janewa, from its habit of growth and the districts in which it is found, is<lb/>
specially suited for haymaking, and the product, when carefully saved,<lb/>
is excellent.
</p>

<p>
Spear grass^ a widely-distributed, excellent forage grass, attaining a<lb/>
height of two to three feet. It is peculiar from the fact that the barbed ends<lb/>
of the seed covers (spears) become so sharp as the grass ripens that they<lb/>
render it quite uneatable. If cut green, and before these spears have<lb/>
hardened, it is an excellent grass and much liked by horses, but if any<lb/>
attempt is made to feed it when too ripe the inside of the mouth will be<lb/>
found stuck full of the barbed seeds, which inflame the gums and<lb/>
prevent mastication till they are removed,<lb/>
or Maniari or Haniari^ the best of the hill grasses, grows to a height<lb/>
of three to four feet. It is a very good fodder when cut young enough<lb/>
and makes capital hay, but before it is cut by the natives it is usually<lb/>
left standing till too old, until, in fact, it is quite woody, and is then<lb/>
comparatively innutritions.
</p>

<p>
Lucertie^ on soils where it flourishes, grows with great luxuriance and<lb/>
may be cultivated and fed to horses instead of grass with the best<lb/>
result. The idea prevalent in India that a pound or two of this plant is<lb/>
enough for a horse, and that more might upset him, is erroneous, and<lb/>
when obtainable it may be fed in practically unlimited quantities.
</p>

<p>
Guinea grass. â This, like lucerne, is usually provided in small<lb/>
quantities as a tit-bit, but when obtainable may be given to the same<lb/>
amount as other green grasses.
</p>

<p>
Khasil., Khawid., are native terms for green wheat, oats, or barley.<lb/>
Up till the time the grain begins to ripen these crops are sometimes cut<lb/>
and fed to horses with good effect. The native practice is to give<lb/>
unlimited quantities, and this sudden change produces a diarrhoea which<lb/>
is regarded as beneficial, but better effects may be obtained from a more<lb/>
gradual introduction of the Khasil into the ration. Wheat and oats<lb/>
may be fed in this way until they are ripening and the straw hardening,<lb/>
but barley should be given only when quite green owing to the<lb/>
indigestibility of the awns.
</p>

<p>
Bamboo leaves and shoots are a staple horse fodder in some eastern<lb/>
districts and are good feeding if a sufficient quantity (average thirty<lb/>
pounds daily) can be obtained. The shoots should be cut quite young<lb/>
and the leaves stripped when green or they are indigestible.

</p>

<p>
Bhfisa is practically " chaff." Crops, whether grain or pulse, are Bhusa.<lb/>
still threshed in the East by bullocks being driven over them in a circle<lb/>
and trampling out the grain. During this process the straw is much<lb/>
broken up and split and is called " Bhusa." It is the main food of<lb/>
working oxen, and in some places of horses, and may always be used<lb/>
with advantage in the same way as chaff. The bhusa obtained from " Safaed<lb/>
the straw of cereals is called "safasd," or " white," and that from other hhOsa."<lb/>
crops, e.g.^ peas and beans, " Missa bhusa." Owing to its mode of Missa<lb/>
preparation it contains much dirt and requires careful screening before bhusa.<lb/>
use.
</p>

<p>
Charri and Karbi, the stalks of millet and maize, may be used as Charri<lb/>
fodder when the crop has been harvested, and they retain sufficient and<lb/>
succulence to be much relished. Charri is readily eaten by horses, but Karbi.<lb/>
the coarser Karbi, unless young, is generally more suitable for cattle,<lb/>
though it may be utilized for all animals on occasion.
</p>

<p>
Egyptian Fodder.
</p>

<p>
Tibbin is broken " chaff," straw, similar to the "bhusa" of India, Tibbin.<lb/>
and to it the same remarks apply. In Egypt, however, barley straw<lb/>
appears to be the only material employed for its production. It is issued<lb/>
as rations instead of hay to all animals in Egypt, and they thrive upon it.
</p>

<p>
Bursim is a variety of trefoil, largely grown during the winter Bursim.<lb/>
months after the Nile flood and, owing to its rapid growth, three or four<lb/>
crops are obtained annually. It is an excellent green food, greedily<lb/>
devoured by all herbivorous animals and may be given in unlimited<lb/>
quantities. When dried it is called " dreis,'^ and forms an excellent hay, Dreis.<lb/>
though, like other clover hays, rather liable to mould. This is the staple<lb/>
green food of Egypt and its value is difficult to overestimate.
</p>

<p>
Dhoura is the stalk of millet and young maize with the, heads and Dhoura.<lb/>
cobs attached. A good general fodder, relished by horses, but said to<lb/>
cause colic when given to them in excess. "Dhoura" is also the name<lb/>
by which millet generally is known in Egypt.
</p>

<p>
Preparation of Food.
</p>

<p>
Cleaning. â Some samples of oats and other grains require cleaning Cleaning,<lb/>
before being fed on account of the quantity of dirt, stones or nails found<lb/>
in them. Some proportion of dirt and stones is unavoidable in grains<lb/>
which are threshed in the open field as they are in Eastern Europe and j^ails in<lb/>
the East generally. Nails, of a broad-headed type, are used to tack foreign<lb/>
canvas linings round to the holds of grain ships, and these not infrequently grain.

become loosened. The large quantity of dust from oats which are very<lb/>
dry, or have been " clipped," will sometimes necessitate their being<lb/>
screened before use.
</p>

<p>
Crushing. â The value of crushing food is that it ensures every grain<lb/>
being thoroughly digested, even though it may have escaped mastication,<lb/>
and the whole nutritive benefit of the amount of food given is thus<lb/>
obtained. With very hard grains, such as old beans and maize, with<lb/>
small thin-husked foreign oats, and with any grain which is newly<lb/>
introduced into the ration, and to which the horse is unaccustomed, it<lb/>
is particularly indicated. An objection which is sometimes urged<lb/>
against crushing the food of troop horses, is that it encourages them to<lb/>
swallow their food without much mastication, and unfits them for eating<lb/>
the rations they are likely to obtain on service. This view is not however<lb/>
borne out by experience, for it is found that horses accustomed to<lb/>
crushed grain as a rule have not proved less hardy and useful on service.<lb/>
In this connexion the use of chaff must be alluded to, for by its<lb/>
admixture with the crushed grain, full mastication becomes a necessity,<lb/>
and liability to bolt food is avoided.
</p>

<p>
It is a matter of some importance that the rollers of the "crusher" or<lb/>
" kibbler " should be set so that the grain shall not be ground to powder,<lb/>
but shall only have the outer husk split. If powdered a proportion of the<lb/>
flour will escape and may be wasted. Oats are easily crushed, beans and<lb/>
peas are split and maize broken, without difficulty, but barley is more<lb/>
resistant, and requires a closer setting of the rollers, and sometimes a<lb/>
second passage through.
</p>

<p>
Parchi?ig is usually employed only in the case of barley, and is fully<lb/>
described under the heading of that grain. (See p. 97.)
</p>

<p>
Soaking.â T\\\s is not a process to be recommended as a rule : its<lb/>
employment in hot weather requires careful supervision, as ferm.entation<lb/>
is apt to take place and render the grain sour. It is sometimes resorted<lb/>
to in the case of grain in India, and a prolonged soaking of twenty-four<lb/>
hours will render linseed eatable if boiling cannot be employed. Under<lb/>
the name of " Steaming," hot water is sometimes used to soak oats for<lb/>
sick horses or delicate feeders.
</p>

<p>
Boilijig. â With two grains, Kulthi and linseed, boiling is a necessity,<lb/>
and it is also frequently utilized for the preparation of barley.
</p>

<p>
On boiled Kulthi and barley, horses may be kept in excellent working<lb/>
condition, but it is not advisable to feed troop horses on boiled rations<lb/>
if it can be avoided.
</p>

<p>
If for no other reason than to avoid the carriage of cauldrons and<lb/>
fuel, boiled food as a ration for troop horses is out of the question.

FOODS AND FEEDING. 121
</p>

<p>
The Utility of boiled foods in the service is limited to their occasional<lb/>
use as condition raisers for horses which require fattening.
</p>

<p>
In England, boiling horses food as a method of preparation is usually Turnip<lb/>
confined to turnip mashes in farm stables ; in Ireland boiled potatoes 'J^.^'^^^-<lb/>
are a common feed on which horses work and maintain condition ; in ^o''^*^<lb/>
hotter countries the value of boiled barley and maize, as part or whole of 130^^^ ^'<lb/>
a feed, is well-known to most careful horse-masters, and as a condition barley and<lb/>
raiser for thin horses they are constantly made use of. That such maize,<lb/>
occasional feeding is harmful to the animals' digestion is a result<lb/>
which has not been observed, and although boiled food is not desirable<lb/>
as a rule, there are occasions where its judicious employment as a<lb/>
change diet for horses out of condition is quite warranted, and the Chaff with<lb/>
results obtained are often excellent. Chaff should be largely mixed with boiled<lb/>
boiled food to compel mastication. foods.
</p>

<p>
The addition of Salt. â The addition of salt to horses' food is not a The<lb/>
necessity, they may be kept in the best condition without it, all the salt addition<lb/>
they actually require for the body's nourishment being contained in their ^ â¢<lb/>
food. But they are very fond of salt, and it is no doubt a pleasant<lb/>
addition to their ration on this account, adding to the attractiveness and<lb/>
palatability of the food and causing them to eat with great relish and<lb/>
enjoyment. When procurable, a large lump of " rock " salt in the manger Rock salt,<lb/>
is a constant attraction, and is sometimes of value in inducing the delicate<lb/>
feeder and shy drinker to attack his meals with greater heartiness.
</p>

<p>
Chaff ("Chop").
</p>

<p>
Whenever possible, hay should be fed as chaff" ; it is economical, and Use ot<lb/>
it ensures the thorough mastication of grain when mixed with it. The chaff eco-<lb/>
principle of feeding hay as chaff is universally recognised in commercial "Â°"^^*^^^-<lb/>
stables as it prevents the waste which occurs through horses pulling<lb/>
long hay out of the racks and soiling it underfoot. It is not always<lb/>
possible, though it would be an advantage, to get a large proportion of<lb/>
hay chopped in the service ; but in any case, sufficient should be pro-<lb/>
vided to mix with each grain feed, and so ensure its thorough mastication.<lb/>
Chaff" may be made from hay only or from a mixture of hay and straw ; Making<lb/>
oat straw for choice ; it should be cut short, but not so short as to make chaff,<lb/>
it a dust â about one inch â and only good quality stuff" should be<lb/>
put into it. It is customary in the trade to chop inferior qualities of hay,<lb/>
and consequently chaff" should always be a hom.e-made article. It is<lb/>
improved by storage in bulk prior to issue, and should be well damped Should be<lb/>
before feeding, with the object of preventing the dust which would damped.

<p>
Otherwise arise from it, irritating the horse's nostrils. If this is not done<lb/>
the snorting of the animal may blow away a considerable quantity of<lb/>
his feed.
</p>

<p>
The economy and utility of chaff feeding cannot be over-estimated ;<lb/>
it should be in every way encouraged when practicable. If very small<lb/>
quantities only are obtainable, greedy feeders should be the first to<lb/>
receive them.
</p>

<p>
Amount of Food.
</p>

<p>
The weight of food required by a hard-working horse varies from<lb/>
about 24 to 32 lbs. of which about half is generally corn, and the remainder<lb/>
must make a sufficiently bulky ration for the class of animal. Bulk is an<lb/>
essential for a horse's diet : concentrated foods, no matter how nourishing,<lb/>
will not maintain condition alone, and although an unlimited supply of<lb/>
corn will sensibly diminish the amount of fodder consumed, it cannot<lb/>
take its place, and the digestion will not support an unlimited corn ration<lb/>
unless a sufficient bulk of fodder accompanies it. This is a notable fact<lb/>
in the practical feeding of horses, and must not be lost sight of. Horses in<lb/>
moderate work require 20 to 24 lbs. of which 10 to 12 lbs. should be corn.<lb/>
As a subsistence ration, half this amount of corn and a full allowance of<lb/>
hay should be allowed.
</p>

<p>
Method of Feeding.
</p>

<p>
There are two distinct . methods of feeding in vogue. In the<lb/>
service and in private stables where long hay is used, horses are fed<lb/>
with corn three or four times daily, and after consuming this a proportion<lb/>
of hay is given. The majority of the hay is reserved till evening when<lb/>
the animals are left with ample leisure to consume and digest it. The<lb/>
other method is that adopted in many commercial stables, where the<lb/>
whole of the hay is chaffed and mixed with the corn ; the supply of food<lb/>
is made practically continuous throughout the day â one horse-keeper<lb/>
being responsible for the feeding of eight to ten horses, and keeping<lb/>
them supplied with the mixture. The same plan is practically followed<lb/>
by the cabman, who puts on the nosebag, containing a mixture of corn<lb/>
and chaff, at every available opportunity. There can be no doubt that<lb/>
the latter of these two methods is preferable, and more in accord with<lb/>
the horse's natural habits, but it is not practicable to carry it out in the<lb/>
army, as the whole of the hay is given long. This being the case waste<lb/>
should be minimised as far as possible by giving small quantities of hay<lb/>
at frequent intervals instead of cramming the racks full once or twice.

FOODS AND FEEDING. I23
</p>

<p>
This can only be satisfactorily accomplished where men are impressed<lb/>
with the benefit to be derived from a practice which gives them extra<lb/>
trouble, and they should be fully instructed in the reasons of insisting<lb/>
on it. A full rack may be given in the evening without wasting as<lb/>
much as would be the case in the day ; the horses are quieter, not so<lb/>
greedy, and have more time to consume it.
</p>

<p>
The following distribution of a day's ration may be taken as a Distribu-<lb/>
guide, but officers are expected to exercise their discretion in adapting tion of<lb/>
their feeding arrangements to the requirements of the work performed ^^^Y<lb/>
at the time : â
</p>

<p>
Morning (before work), oats 3 lb. (mixed with chaff) Hay, a small hand-<lb/>
ful.<lb/>
Mid-day (after â ), â 3 ,, ( â â " ) 1 ^^Y continuously
</p>

<p>
Evening â 4 â ( â^ â ,, ) J till evening stables.
</p>

<p>
when the remainder may be given.
</p>

<p>
If it is not possible to feed the hay as above, then give half at<lb/>
mid-day, and half at evening stables.
</p>

<p>
When the corn ration is more than 12 lb. it is better to feed four<lb/>
times instead of three.
</p>

<p>
Principles of Feeding.
</p>

<p>
As the result of experience three rules have been laid down as<lb/>
guiding principles in feeding : â
</p>

<p>
( 1 ) Water before feedmg.
</p>

<p>
(2) Feed in small qicantities aiid often.
</p>

<p>
(3) Do 7iot work hard immediately after a full feed.
</p>

<p>
(i) Water before feeding. â This is the established custom in the Water<lb/>
service, but it is not invariably followed outside the army, although very before<lb/>
general. The reasons for its adoption are as follows : â The horse *^^ding.<lb/>
drinks very rapidly, and in large gulps ; the water runs quickly through<lb/>
the gullet, stomach, and small bowel into the water-gut. If you put<lb/>
your ear to the side of a horse drinking, the rushing of the water<lb/>
can be heard. Such a stream passing through an already full stomach<lb/>
would wash a considerable portion of the contents with it into the bowel,<lb/>
and if the meal is only just finished, they would not be sufficiently mixed<lb/>
with the gastric juice. As a consequence their digestion would be<lb/>
incomplete, and this means an avoidable loss of nourishment, and,<lb/>
perhaps, indigestion and colic. Some owners make a practice of

<p>
watering after feeding, and as horses readily become accustomed to<lb/>
any mechod which is systematically adopted, actual illness does not<lb/>
result as frequently as might be imagined, but the practice is unsound,<lb/>
and as a matter of fact is becoming less and less common.
</p>

<p>
It must not be imagined^ however, that "water before feeding"<lb/>
means "do not give any water till the next meal." The horse's stomach<lb/>
is, as a matter of fact, never really empty, some food usually remains in<lb/>
it ; but within an hour of feeding water may be given if desired ; and<lb/>
when left constantly with the horse it will be found that a sip or two is<lb/>
frequently taken, but not a long draught.
</p>

<p>
A working horse, especially if tired and hot, will naturally swallow<lb/>
an inordinate quantity of water very rapidly, and the common-sense<lb/>
application of this rule, is to allow him the opportunity of quenching his<lb/>
thirst before giving him a dry corn feed.<lb/>
Feed in (2) Feed ifi small qiicnitities â¢and often. â The digestive apparatus of
</p>

<p>
small the horse is arranged to admit of leisurely feeding for many hours at a
</p>

<p>
?l'^"iffl!f stretch. The stomach is small, and cannot contain large quantities at<lb/>
a time like that of the ox, there is no gall bladder to store up the bile,<lb/>
which flows constantly from the liver directly into the bowel, but the<lb/>
capacious bowels are capable of accommodating a large quantity of food<lb/>
during slow digestion. The bulk of the food then does not stay long in<lb/>
the stomach, but once it is about two-thirds full, passes through at the<lb/>
rate that it is taken into the mouth, until feeding is finished. A horse<lb/>
out at pasture spends most of his time eating, steadily grazing by the<lb/>
hour ; the only variations he allows himself are an occasional short<lb/>
gallop with others, a brief and infrequent visit to the stream, and a few<lb/>
hours' rest. But the working horse receives at stated intervals a large<lb/>
amount of very stimulating and palatable food which he learns to eat<lb/>
with rapidity. The stomach works best when it is about two-thirds full.<lb/>
If these periodical feeds, which require a good deal of digestion, are<lb/>
too large, there is a danger of the animal over-distending the stomach, and<lb/>
so incurring the risk of indigestion. A feed of 3 lb. to 4 lb. of oats, mixed<lb/>
with a couple of handsful of chaff represents when chewed and mixed<lb/>
with saliva the amount which the average horse is capable of consuming<lb/>
to the best advantage at a meal. This may be followed by a long and<lb/>
slow consumption of hay, and the gradual passage of the food into the<lb/>
bowel takes place under favourable conditions. But if the feed is much<lb/>
larger it causes a distension of the elastic stomach, and a corresponding<lb/>
weakening of its digestive power. Should this overloading be very<lb/>
excessive the stomach is stretched to such an extent as to be incapable<lb/>
of effort, the food soon ferments, gas is given off from it, and acute

</p>

<p>
indigestion, which may lead to rupture of the stomach, ensues. If, then,<lb/>
a horse is to be given a larger ciuantity of corn than usual, it is not wise<lb/>
to increase the size of each feed, but to give the extra quantity as an<lb/>
additional meal. This plan of increasing the number instead of the<lb/>
quantity of feeds is more particularly to be recommended for the<lb/>
conditioning of thin horses ; since their digestions as well as their<lb/>
muscles are weak, and unable to cope with much at a time.
</p>

<p>
The principle of feeding in small quantities and often is, as previously<lb/>
noted, thoroughly carried out in some of the best managed commercial<lb/>
studs ; the total amount of food is handed over to the horse-keeper and<lb/>
it is left to him to keep his horses continually supplied with small<lb/>
quantities throughout the day. The whole of the hay is, of course, chafted<lb/>
to avoid waste and the animals learn to eat leisurely, thus avoiding any<lb/>
chance of overloading the stomach.
</p>

<p>
(3) Do not work hard imniediately after a full feed. â Immediately Do not<lb/>
after a meal the stomach and bowels are actually bigger than before, they }^'0'"k hard<lb/>
contain more water and food and are perhaps slightly distended by gases !^'J^g"^f^ftgj,<lb/>
resulting from the digestive process, consequently they occupy more ^ i^^^x feed,<lb/>
room than was the case just previous to feeding. The extra room is<lb/>
provided by a little filling out of the belly generally and also â and this is<lb/>
the important point â by the bulging forwards of the stomach against the<lb/>
diaphragm (Fig. 2, p. 12). On the otherside of the diaphragm (midrift) lie the<lb/>
lungs ; any pressure on them impedes their power of expansion, and it is<lb/>
for this reason that strong' work immediately after a meal causes instant<lb/>
blowing and distress. The lungs cannot expand and contract with sufficient<lb/>
facility to get rid of their contained blood and provide the amount of<lb/>
fresh air necessary for it, and laboured breathing is the result. If hard<lb/>
work is persisted in under these conditions either the lungs get choked<lb/>
with blood or the digestion stops ; the latter is most serious, rupture<lb/>
of the stomach as a result of gaseous distension being not uncommon.<lb/>
Heavy draught or fast work should therefore be avoided directly after a full<lb/>
feed, but no harm results from continuing a quiet journey.
</p>

<p>
Grazing.<lb/>
To the working horse fed constantly on hard food, grazing Grazing a<lb/>
and green stuff are the acme of luxury and enjoyment, and in addition the luxury to<lb/>
effect of green grass on the digestion is beneficial. No occasion should working<lb/>
be neglected if grazing, for even the shortest period, is obtainable. Many *-*^*^^-<lb/>
opportunities for a brief bite may pass unnoticed by a thoughtless,<lb/>
careless or untrained man, and every mounted soldier should be taught

that the use of his eyes in this matter is as much a duty as any other part<lb/>
of his military education. In many stations exercise may be combined<lb/>
with grazing, and where government or pubHc land is available, parties<lb/>
may be sent out under a non-commissioned officer at any convenient time.<lb/>
Men should be encouraged to take their horses out to any available patch<lb/>
about the barracks : halts on the march, at field days, whenever<lb/>
dismounted, may sometimes be taken advantage of without interfering<lb/>
with other duty, provided the man has been accustomed on such<lb/>
occasions to look round on his horse's account. Incidentally the<lb/>
practice of grazing may be taken advantage of to accustom horses to<lb/>
knee haltering and to teach them to stand without being held. Horses<lb/>
that are trained to graze and stand quietly acquire habits which are most<lb/>
valuable in the field.
</p>

<p>
Bulk<lb/>

</p>

<p>
Effect of
</p>

<p>
bulky
</p>

<p>
food.
</p>

<p>
Application of Principles.
</p>

<p>
In the practical appiicatioji of the principles of feeding, shrewd<lb/>
observation of the animal under all conditions, and sound common-sense<lb/>
in stable arrangements must be added to the knowledge which may be<lb/>
usefully derived from a book. All are not equally gifted in this respect,<lb/>
but anyone of average intelligence can make himself sufficiently familiar<lb/>
with the details of animal management to keep healthy horses in good<lb/>
condition, provided he not only reads up the subject but also takes the<lb/>
trouble to acquire that practical knowledge which only observation can<lb/>
give. Whatever the work, the food must be suitable in amount and quality.
</p>

<p>
Bulk esse?itiaL â Without sufficient bulk, condition cannot be maintained<lb/>
for long, however nourishing the food, but where fast work is required and<lb/>
the lighter class of horse concerned, the bulk should naturally be less than<lb/>
when heavy, slow work and draught horses are to be legislated for, and a<lb/>
fine class of hay or other fodder is desirable. The effect of bulky food on<lb/>
the respiration immediately after a meal has also to be borne in mind<lb/>
relative to the class of work and for this reason it is ifiadvisable to feed<lb/>
with hay to any extoit before the day's work begins, if it is to be of a fast<lb/>
character. Exhausting work has a temporarily weakening effect on the<lb/>
digestion, and tired horses should be allowed to recover from its effects<lb/>
before they are asked to digest a heavy meal. Plenty of water, a mouth-<lb/>
ful of hay, a small and sloppy feed and warmth, until the system has<lb/>
recovered from exhaustion, should be the treatment prescribed in such<lb/>
cases.
</p>

<p>
Generally speaking, horses are, when once in condition, hardy, greedy<lb/>
animals, and, if judiciously fed and worked, easy to keep in good heart and

<p>
flesh, but occasionally a timid^ delicate feeder will be met, more especially<lb/>
in the light, well-bred class. If carefully treated such animals may<lb/>
become quite normal feeders, and they improve in this respect as they<lb/>
carry more flesh. They should be fed apart until they show good appetite<lb/>
and will often feed at night, although they w^U not clear up in the day ; if<lb/>
this is the case no more than they will consume at the moment should be<lb/>
given at each feed until nightfall, w^hen they may be left with an ample<lb/>
supply. For such horses a constant water supply is often of the greatest<lb/>
benefit, and frequent changes of food are attended with good results ;<lb/>
small quantities of scraped carrots or chopped green meat mixed with<lb/>
the grain feed will often tempt them to eat much more than they other-<lb/>
wise would, whilst rock salt may be profitably left in the manger.
</p>

<p>
Feeding of Special Cases.
</p>

<p>
Horses which bolt their food. â In open stables horses learn to feed Horses<lb/>
greedily ; they consume their grain with the greatest rapidity, either to which bolt<lb/>
see what they can steal from their neighbours or from fear that they will ^"^^^ ^Â°Â°"-<lb/>
themselves be robbed. To prevent the greedy habit as much as possible,<lb/>
chaff should form a part of each feed, and the more the better. Any horses<lb/>
which, in spite of this, are known to bolt their food, should have it spread<lb/>
out thinly over as wide a surface as possible to prevent them getting<lb/>
large mouthfuls ; a manger with several bars across the top to<lb/>
divide it into compartments, or a few large round stones placed<lb/>
among the feed are also methods of preventing the bolter from securing<lb/>
the huge mouthful which he delights in.
</p>

<p>
Horses subject to diat-rhcca as a result of work should have their corn. Horses<lb/>
of whatever variety it is. well ground to assist their digestion ; the addi- subject to<lb/>
tion of a little dry bran to each feed is also a good plan, but water should diarrhoea<lb/>
not be withheld from such horses under the idea that it will keep the Qf^Q^k"<lb/>
bowels firm. They are usually excitable animals, and the diarrhoea is<lb/>
really a nervous affection ; when at rest the droppings of such animals are<lb/>
quite normal.
</p>

<p>
Windsiickers a?id crib-biters should, if possible, be fed apart from the Wind-<lb/>
rest and in such a way as to prevent them practising the habit. Turning suckers<lb/>
them round m the stall on the pillar chains, and feeding from a mov- ^^ ^"Â°"<lb/>
able manger and hay net is a very useful method in stables, and the<lb/>
wearing of a hollow bit or cribbing strap is a preventive. When the crib-<lb/>
biter can be accommodated in a box, with four blank walls, and fed off<lb/>
the ground, this is the best plan, till he learns to windsuck. The habit<lb/>
may be learnt by adjacent horses and hence the desirability of separating<lb/>
those which have acquired it.

Young<lb/>

</p>

<p>
Old<lb/>
horses.
</p>

<p>
Horses wJiicli have had fe%'er 171 the feet or have thick legs should<lb/>
have the amount of their food very nicely regulated, according to the<lb/>
work they do and if rested, even for a short time, should have their<lb/>
rations proportionately decreased. Complete rest, after they have once got<lb/>
into a good condition, is not good for such, and they should always<lb/>
receive a sufficient amount of exercise to keep the circulation of their<lb/>
limbs active, and no more food than suffices for their actual daily<lb/>
requirements.
</p>

<p>
Horses affected in the wind may be, if not so bad as to be useless, greatly<lb/>
unproved by keeping the bulk of their food down to the smallest possible<lb/>
limits ; avoiding the use of coarse fodder, feeding chaff only instead of<lb/>
long hay, and taking special care not to let them feed just before work.<lb/>
It is not, of course, advisable to retain horses badly broken winded,<lb/>
but the above routine will enable as much use to be got out of them<lb/>
as possible.
</p>

<p>
Thin horses. â Naturally, a horse is not a thin animal, and usually a<lb/>
thin horse is over-worked, badly fed, or has something the matter with<lb/>
him. A thorough expert examination should be made to try and find<lb/>
any specific cause for the condition, and possibly the teeth or bowels may<lb/>
be found to require attention. The feeding of a thin but otherwise<lb/>
healthy horse, should take into account the fact that the weakness of the<lb/>
muscles of his limbs is reflected in the muscles of his bowels and stomach,<lb/>
and until he gains strength he is not capable of digesting large feeds<lb/>
without running the risk of indigestion and colic. Little and often should,<lb/>
then, in such 'cases be very strictly observed, and as the bodily strength<lb/>
grows and work is proportionately increased, so the quantity of each feed<lb/>
may be added to. For putting flesh on horses, boiled barley, maize and<lb/>
linseed are very useful and may be given at least once daily, but the<lb/>
quantity of the last should never be excessive. An unlimited water supply<lb/>
is also an important factor in the restoration of thin, weak horses to<lb/>
condition.
</p>

<p>
Young ho7'ses require great care and judgment when first brought into<lb/>
work. They want liberal but not over-feeding and should not be<lb/>
allowed to lose their bloom and flesh, which is difficult to restore if once<lb/>
lost as the result of injudicious work or feeding during their first lessons.<lb/>
Starting with about a half ration of corn and a liberal supply of fodder<lb/>
and green stuff, or carrots if procurable, the grain should be increased in<lb/>
proportion to the work exacted, and this should in no case be excessive.<lb/>
Once in condition young horses are easy to feed and keep fit.
</p>

<p>
Old ho?'ses^ say sixteen years or older, require a larger proportion of<lb/>
stimulating food than young ones to keep condition and perform the same

amount of work, and the addition of beans or peas to their rations is an<lb/>
excellent practice when hard work is demanded.
</p>

<p>
Watering.
</p>

<p>
Qiumtity required. â According to the temperature and work horses Quantity<lb/>
will require anything from five to fifteen gallons a day, an average required,<lb/>
quantity being eight. Hot weather and hard work, or both combined,<lb/>
will nearly double ordinary requirements, and in making any calculation<lb/>
of the amount required these factors must be considered.
</p>

<p>
Quality of water. â Horses are said to prefer soft water, but it is not Quality of<lb/>
a point of much practical importance, for most stabled horses are given water,<lb/>
hard water and thrive on it, and the best horse-breeding districts are<lb/>
those with a limestone foundation where a great deal of the water is<lb/>
hard. It should in any case be fresh, pure, and well aerated, free from<lb/>
taste, smell and colour.
</p>

<p>
VVateri77g trougJis should be of sufficient height to prevent restless Watering<lb/>
animals pawing over the rim and should not present any sharp angles or troughs,<lb/>
corners. The depth of water need not be great, eight or ten inches<lb/>
being sufficient if the supply is free enough to maintain it whilst the<lb/>
trough is in use, but it should be broad and allow at least a yard of<lb/>
length for each animal.
</p>

<p>
Periods of watering. â The structure of the horse's bowels is adapted Periods of<lb/>
for taking in large quantities of water at comparatively infrequent watering,<lb/>
intervals. Three times daily may be counted an average number. In<lb/>
cool weather and when not at work horses will themselves drink only<lb/>
twice daily, but under such conditions they get a good deal of moisture<lb/>
from their grazing. In work, especially when weather is warm, four<lb/>
times daily should be the rule. Water should be given previous to<lb/>
feeding (p. 123).
</p>

<p>
Horses should not be watered for at least an hour after feeding, but<lb/>
they may be allowed to drink freely whilst at work, even though sweating.<lb/>
If brought in hot they may be watered immediately, but should be kept<lb/>
moving until they have cooled down. The idea that horses require<lb/>
chilled water is a fallacy. The London cab-horse drinks ice-cold water<lb/>
in the winter, after working hard, and stands still in the street for hours<lb/>
afterwards without ill-effects.
</p>

<p>
Care should be taken not to allow too many horses to water at once,<lb/>
only such number as there is plenty of room for being taken to the<lb/>
trough. They should be allowed ample time to drink their fill and not<lb/>

CHAPTER VI.
</p>

<p>
MANAGEMENT OF HORSES IN THE OPEN.<lb/>
Condition and Exercise.
</p>

<p>
" Condilion^^ as applied to animals, means thorough bodily, muscular " Condi-<lb/>
fitness for the work required. When using the term "condition," the ton."<lb/>
picture of a racehorse, each muscle outlined, and strung up to crowd the<lb/>
greatest possible exertion into the shortest possible time, is apt to cross<lb/>
the mind ; but although this type exemplifies " condition " in its highest<lb/>
degree, it may not truly represent the bodily state required for the<lb/>
particular work in hand. The condition of the racehorse is a maximum ; Racing<lb/>
it represents a maximum of food, a maximum of work, and a concen- condition,<lb/>
trated nervous energy which cannot be maintained at concert pitch<lb/>
indefinitely ; the acme having been reached reaction is inevitable, and<lb/>
unless a judicious easy is allowed, loss of form and condition follow.<lb/>
Such a high strung, nervous state is not required in workaday horses,<lb/>
such as the soldier's, and although thorough fitness is absolutely<lb/>
essential, the standard to be aimed at is not that of the five furlong<lb/>
sprinter. A well-regulated stable of hunters during the first part of the Hunters'<lb/>
season exhibits the quality of condition which should be looked for at condition,<lb/>
the commencement of a campaign : the body well covered with flesh, and<lb/>
that hardened on ; no sign of running up light towards the flank ; full of<lb/>
spirits, capable of long-continued exertion without fatigue, and with<lb/>
a good digestion waiting on a healthy appetite. Such a state of bodily<lb/>
health can be almost indefinitely continued when once attained, and<lb/>
allows some reserve of flesh and animal spirits to draw on when the<lb/>
pinch of hardship comes. This class of condition is the criterion of a Value of<lb/>
horse's value on service ; blood, power and good looks are of little value condition<lb/>
without it ; its value in war is not to be estimated in money and cannot '" ^^^â¢<lb/>
be purchased for it, whilst unless the animals of an army possess it they<lb/>
are valueless as weapons and may even be a danger to their owners.<lb/>
Condition of this description must not be confounded with fatness. The Dealer's<lb/>
nice, fresh, young horse from the dealer's yard is fat, not fit ; his muscles condition.<lb/>

Not only his muscles, but every other structure in him is in the same state;<lb/>
his blood-vessels soon lose their elasticity ; his heart fails in driving- power ;<lb/>
his lungs cannot sustain rapid breathing, nor his joints constant bending;<lb/>
and although he is jumping out of his skin at the beginning of the day,<lb/>
a very moderate amount of work makes you wonder if he is the same<lb/>

<p>
There is only one way to get animals into condition, whether they be<lb/>
required for light cavalry or heavy transport â sufficient good food and<lb/>
sufficient healthy exercise, judiciously combined, and continued over a<lb/>
long period, is the sole recipe. The transformation of fat, flabby flesh<lb/>
into hard, tough muscle is a gradual process, it cannot be forced ; a regular<lb/>
course of graduated exercise is the only way to accomplish it. This work<lb/>
should never be so severe as to fatigue the animal ; the soft muscles will<lb/>
suffer from the reaction of over-exertion to such an extent that an actual<lb/>
loss of flesh will result. Working tired animals when unfit is a most<lb/>
fruitful cause of accident and disease, and the worst possible horsemaster-<lb/>
ship ; this is the time when they sustain bad falls and severe sprains ; the<lb/>
muscles do not act in absolute unison, and extra weight is thrown on the<lb/>
tendons, which naturally sufler. But, once good, hard, muscular develop-<lb/>
ment has been attained, any work within reason will not only be performed<lb/>
without great effort, but will continue to add to the quality of the condition<lb/>
already acquired. It is important to recognise this "cumulative" power<lb/>
of condition ; it means that you can not only demand a good amount of<lb/>
work from a seasoned horse, but that it actually does him good, and while<lb/>
performing it he will at the same time run less and less risk of accident<lb/>
and disease ; but throw him entirely out of work for any considerable<lb/>
period, and you will have to repeat the conditioning process over again,<lb/>
though not perhaps to quite the same extent. This must be particularly<lb/>
borne in mind when animals are again taken into work after a run at<lb/>
grass or a long bout of sickness.

an off-day. On all occasions when it is possible, three or four hours<lb/>
should be spent in the open air daily, the simple fact of being in and<lb/>
breathing a pure atmosphere having a good effect on the health and<lb/>
spirits.
</p>

<p>
The bulk of the work should be done at a slow pace. â The troop horse The bulk<lb/>
gets more than enough fast galloping work during the necessary training of the<lb/>
of the men, and at field days and manoeuvres ; his conditioning and ^^'^^ , ,<lb/>
exercise should be carried out at the walk and trot, the proportion ^qÂ°" ^j. ^<lb/>
being about four or three to one respectively. Though impossible to glow pace,<lb/>
carry out in the Service, the exercise of the racehorse may be taken<lb/>
as an ideal. Two or two and a half hours constantly on the move in<lb/>
the morning, with two or three miles' trot and canter thrown in, and<lb/>
one to one and a half hour's walk in the evening, is the class of<lb/>
exercise which is given to get the animal fit to commence the faster<lb/>
part of his preparation, and even when this is in progress the long<lb/>
walking is continued. Plenty of walking, then, and a moderate amount<lb/>
of trotting should constitute the " healthy exercise " for getting into Healthy<lb/>
working condition and for maintaining it. Any attempt to try and exercise,<lb/>
crowd extra work into less time under the impression that it will have<lb/>
the same effect should be specially avoided and cannot be too strongly<lb/>
condemned ; it does not harden muscle on the animal in the same way,<lb/>
but tends to run the meat off him, make him tucked up in the belly,<lb/>
perhaps irritable in the temper, as well as unduly heated on return from<lb/>
work and therefore more liable to chills.
</p>

<p>
The exercise should not follow the same route every day. â Horses have The<lb/>
a wonderful memory in such matters, and as soon as they think they exercise<lb/>
are on the direct road home, will often hurry, fidget and sweat till they ?^Â°^^*^ "Â°^<lb/>
get there. This nervous effect may usually be avoided by taking a ^Â° Â°^^ ,^<lb/>
different direction daily, breaking the work a httle by an occasional halt, everyday,<lb/>

</p>

<p>
accustomed to the pressure of the load for hours at a stretch, sore<lb/>
backs will result, however good the general condition.
</p>

<p>
Effect of feeding 071 condition. â To produce the best results, the policy<lb/>
of full feeding and fair work must be adopted. No other combination<lb/>
will get the best out of an animal. A small ration and little work will<lb/>
keep him round in appearance, but whether a camel or a charger, plenty<lb/>
of food and sufficient work, judiciously combined, is the only routine<lb/>
which will really fit him for use in war. This adjustment of ration to<lb/>
work is a practical point which a book cannot teach ; it is one of the<lb/>
hall-marks of a good horsemaster and must be gained by observation<lb/>
and experience. When the work is light, e.g.^ at the beginning of a<lb/>
young horse's training, half a full corn ration is generally accepted as<lb/>
a standard on which to begin feeding, but a rule of thumb method<lb/>
should be avoided and each horse's needs considered ; in no case<lb/>
should the ration be so small, or the work so hard, that the colt's<lb/>
" bloom," i.e.^ his round and glossy sleekness, disappears.
</p>

<p>
Thirst and sweating are very prominent features of the early stages<lb/>
of training, and are to some extent dependent on each other. Apart<lb/>
from the sweating which may naturally be expected as a result of work,<lb/>
some young horses are liable to sweat very profusely from purely nervous<lb/>
causes, and more especially when the work is conducted in a confined<lb/>
atmosphere.
</p>

<p>
It is not always possible to prevent every young horse SAveating from<lb/>
the excitement of new lessons, particularly in the case of highly bred or<lb/>
excitable colts ; but such outbreaks take more out of a horse than a far<lb/>
greater amount of quiet work, and should be avoided in every way.
</p>

<p>
Working in the open air in preference to a roofed school, absolute<lb/>
quietness of methods, the avoidance of long monotonous lessons, and<lb/>
the example of older, well-behaved animals, doing the same things<lb/>
quietly, are all valuable in keeping horses cool in body and temper ;<lb/>
but there are instances, as stated above, where sweating cannot be<lb/>
prevented, and thirst is a natural result. Thirsty horses are to be<lb/>
allowed to drink their fill ; it is best that they should not be sweating,<lb/>
but the fact of their being hot need not be a bar to their drinking, if<lb/>
care is taken to keep them on the move till cool, and so prevent risk of<lb/>
chills. As their condition improves the keenness of their thirst will<lb/>
diminish.
</p>

<p>
The quantity and quality of the stveat is very generally taken as an<lb/>
index of condition, and rightly so. When the body is soft and flabby,<lb/>
slight exertion produces a copious sweating, of a soapy, lathery nature,<lb/>
which dries slowly, and frequently breaks out again. As the condition

<p>
improves, the amount of work required to make the skin damp increases,<lb/>
and the sweat itself is less greasy and more watery in consistence ;<lb/>
while it dries with rapidity, and does not recur. There are, however,<lb/>
some free-sweating horses which lather freely even when in good fettle.<lb/>
Weather has a great influence on the amount animals perspire, for<lb/>
whereas on a cold, clear day it takes a lot of exertion to turn a hair, a<lb/>
damp muggy morning will make them sweat freely.
</p>

<p>
On THE March.
</p>

<p>
It is taken for granted that the horses are in " condition," without<lb/>
which it is impossible for them to undergo the fatigue and exertion<lb/>
incident to any prolonged effort. This has already been dealt with under<lb/>
the heading of " Condition," but the importance of the point riiust be Length ot<lb/>
again insisted upon. Looked at solely from the animal's point of view, the march,<lb/>
length of a march is to be estimated not only in miles, but also with<lb/>
regard to the number of hours that the load has to be carried, and this<lb/>
latter consideration is frequently the more important of the two. The<lb/>
advance of a column on service is occasionally at the rate of one<lb/>
mile in four or five hours, and under such circumstances, a five mile<lb/>
march on paper may call for the exhibition of extreme endurance in<lb/>
reality. If under the pressure of circumstances the marching of un-<lb/>
conditioned animals is necessary, unless the military necessities of the<lb/>
case are such as to override all thought of loss, the distances to be<lb/>
covered and the time occupied must be comparatively short, or<lb/>
exhaustion and sore backs will shortly account for the majority.
</p>

<p>
Previous to starting, a special inspection of the saddlery and shoeing Inspectior<lb/>
should be undertaken, to make sure that all is in order, but alterations to before<lb/>
saddlery should only be made if they are absolutely unavoidable : starting,<lb/>
eleventh hour alterations are not always judicious, and unless actual<lb/>
injury is apparent, saddlery is better let alone at this moment. Shoes<lb/>
should as far as possible be new. Wear varies considerably in different Wear ot<lb/>
horses : on a macadamized road, especially if the weather is wet, hard shoes.<lb/>
wearers will get through good hind shoes in between loo and 150 miles,<lb/>
and the average for road work will vary from 200 to 300 miles according<lb/>
to the pattern and weight of the shoes.
</p>

<p>
Hour of Starti7ig.â\i is seldom advisable, unless for purely military Hour ot<lb/>
reasons, to start before daylight, even with the object of avoiding heat, starting.<lb/>

<p>
forgotten. Night marches are slower and more fatiguing than in the<lb/>
day, and miless the read is well known may possibly be lengthened by<lb/>
errors of direction.
</p>

<p>
Choice of Ground.â AXiervtAon should always be paid to the condition of<lb/>
the ground travelled over, the pace being increased when the going is<lb/>
good ; and bad, heavy, or newly metalled pieces walked over. Riding<lb/>
horses should be kept off the road if the going at the sides is soft and<lb/>
suitable. Vehicles should always keep to the hardest and smoothest routes.
</p>

<p>
Steep hills are particularly suitable places to relieve the horses of<lb/>
weight and let the men walk.
</p>

<p>
Pace. â Always remembering the fatigue which the weight carried<lb/>
produces, irrespective of the distance travelled, the maintenance of a<lb/>
good average pace throughout the entire journey is to be desired, and,<lb/>
provided it is not unduly hurried at any point, the cjuicker a journey is<lb/>
completed the less fatiguing is it to both horse and rider. The actual<lb/>
mileage per hour will naturally vary with the unit concerned : taking the<lb/>
walk at four miles per hour, the trot at eight to ten, cavalry and mounted<lb/>
infantry, unaccompanied by other arms, should maintain a rate of five to<lb/>
six miles an hour including halts, over any ordinary distance, and this<lb/>
rate is capable of being kept up for very long journeys where the<lb/>
animals are accustomed to travel at the canter. Horse artillery can<lb/>
travel at the same pace as cavalry, field artillery at four miles, and<lb/>
transport at three miles an hour under favourable conditions.
</p>

<p>
Single horsemen with a thorough knowledge of the work and with<lb/>
mounts in the pink of condition may be able to travel forty to fifty miles<lb/>
at the rate of twelve or fourteen miles an hour ; but such a pace cannot<lb/>
be expected from any body of horsemen ; and the larger the force the<lb/>
slower will be the progress as a rule (see also " Cavalry Training," sec.<lb/>
143). Forty or fifty miles a day, if continued for several days, will test<lb/>
the condition of both horse and man very thoroughly, and even this<lb/>
result cannot be attained without severe loss unless the men are practised<lb/>
in the work and both they and the horses are as hard as nails.
</p>

<p>
The pace should be varied as much as possible, walk, trot and canter<lb/>
being all utilized, and the last of these is found by all long-distance riders to<lb/>
be the easiest pace for both horse and man on a journey. No pace should<lb/>
be maintained so long, without a break, as to weary either horse or man,<lb/>
but after ten or fifteen minutes' trot and canter a short walk should follow.<lb/>
To a very large extent the men should walk whenever the horses do, in<lb/>
order to relieve them of the weight ; and this procedure has the further<lb/>
advantage of lessening the strain on the men themselves by bringing<lb/>
into play other muscles besides those exerted in riding.

</p>

<p>
Halts. â A first halt should be made after going one or two miles, to Halts,<lb/>
allow the horses to stale ; make sure that the saddlery and harness is all<lb/>
correct and tighten the girths. It need not be more than a few minutes,<lb/>
but it is a very necessary precaution, more especially if the start is made<lb/>
at dawn when the light is poor and some detail in saddling may have<lb/>
escaped attention.
</p>

<p>
Subsequently, a short halt of five to ten minutes should be made hourly<lb/>
and every two or three hours a sufficiently long one, to off-saddle and<lb/>
feed. If it is not possible to off-saddle, girths should be loosened and the<lb/>
saddle just raised off the back, to relieve pressure and allow the<lb/>
circulation of the skin to be restored. When the saddles are removed the<lb/>
horse should be allowed to roll and the back dried. At every halt<lb/>
stirrups should be put up to prevent accidents from catching the hind foot<lb/>
in the iron, and each man should look round his horse and at each shoe.
</p>

<p>
Formation. â The broadest front is the best for horses, and should be Forma-<lb/>
adopted whenever possible. It enables every animal to see the ground tion.<lb/>
over which he is travelling and ensures a supply of fresh air, free from<lb/>
dust â an important consideration on a long, hot day. Where a road has<lb/>
to be followed, the force should, so far as the military situation permits. Avoid<lb/>
travel in small bodies, with a sufficient interval between them to allow dust,<lb/>
dust to settle or blow away. On hot, still days, the horses in the centre<lb/>
and rear of a long narrow column breathe an atmosphere thicker than a<lb/>
London fog throughout the journey, and this must help materially to<lb/>
produce fatigue " sooner than would otherwise be the case. It is most<lb/>
important, especially when the column is a long one, to prevent the whole<lb/>
force being affected by momentary checks which may occur in front. To<lb/>
avoid this a short interval should be maintained between squadrons<lb/>
whenever tactical conditions allow it. Any animal or vehicle meeting<lb/>
with accident should be immediately drawn to the side of the road and<lb/>
not be allowed to obstruct the passage of the remainder.
</p>

<p>
Watering. â Horses may be watered whenever opportunity occurs, Watering,<lb/>
especially on hot days, and there is little risk attached to their being<lb/>
allowed to drink frequently. The usual method of watering before<lb/>
feeding will, of course, be adhered to, but if a stream is crossed an hour<lb/>
after feeding they may again be allowed to drink if circumstances permit<lb/>
of the delay. Bits are to be removed when it is intended to give a full<lb/>
watering.
</p>

<p>
When water is scarce its issue must be carefully regulated to avoid When<lb/>
any waste. Horses can drink from a very shallow vessel if -their water is<lb/>
bridles are removed, and taking advantage of this fact, small quantities<lb/>
may be poured into a shallow dish, from which they drink, the supply

being regulated by the animal's rate of swallowing. It is a plan adopted<lb/>
by some regiments of Indian Cavalry, and may be conveniently employed<lb/>
where water is carried in skins or small tanks. A very small quantity<lb/>
will revive overtaxed horses and it should be given in repeated little<lb/>
rations rather than in one long draught. When the amount is very scanty,<lb/>
say a pint or less, it is best to offer the exact quantity to each in turn<lb/>
rather than to risk a large bucketful, as the first-comers are sure to get<lb/>
an undue proportion and may upset it in their eagerness. On one<lb/>
occasion during the campaign for the relief of Khartoum the Syrian horses<lb/>
of the 19th Hussars received no water for fifty-five hours and twenty of<lb/>
them for seventy hours. On another occasion when much exhausted and<lb/>
thirty-five miles from water, less than one pint per horse was available.<lb/>
This was mixed with meal into a number of soft balls, which revived<lb/>
Native them, and they accomplished the remainder of the journey the next<lb/>
morning. In regard to this particular point it must be noted that thirst<lb/>
is better endured in hot climates by animals which are native to them,<lb/>

<p>
Conditions P^^ce, whether at home or abroad, there is the certainty of receiving a<lb/>
of peace sufficient ration at stated intervals, and practically no thought is required<lb/>
and war from officer or man in connection with its provision ; but in war the<lb/>
compared, conditions are entirely changed and demand special attention, for while<lb/>
a mounted soldier's chief weapon is his horse, it is also the most<lb/>
difficult to keep in working order on service. For a man accustomed<lb/>
throughout his life to the care of horses, more particularly in a new or<lb/>
uncivilized country, it is a matter of simple routine to provide for his<lb/>
horse's wants at every possible opportunity ; it becomes automatic with<lb/>
him to think for his horse ; but the average soldier has not had such<lb/>
training and experience, and unless it is thoroughly drilled into him that<lb/>
he must think of and for his horse on all occasions, the latter is apt to<lb/>
suffer.<lb/>
Provision It is in the matter of fodder that the difficulty of providing sufficient

<p>
of fodder horse rations is likely to be felt oftenest ; corn may be supplied with<lb/>
attention ^^^ijlarity, but hay or other fodder is very bulky, and its punctual issue<lb/>
cannot be relied upon. Every mounted man should be made fully aware<lb/>
of his duty to his horse in this respect. Standing crops of all descrip-<lb/>
tions provide excellent fodder, and should not be passed without the<lb/>
horse being catered for ; while, if circumstances permit, a sufficient<lb/>
quantity should be carried, to provide for the next halt. Opportunities

<p>
for grazing may occur : when halted the horse will not fail to avail himself Oppor-<lb/>
of them if the man allows him. Especially do the scout, the orderly, tumties ot<lb/>
and the small party on detached duty, meet with such opportunities ; *^^J^|^"^^<lb/>
but unless the men are so trained that it has become second nature to<lb/>
take advantage of them, many will be missed from want of thought or<lb/>
observation, when the mind is occupied by more exciting details. Visits<lb/>
to farmhouses may offer the chance to replenish empty nosebags, and<lb/>
these should be kept full, no matter what the contents, so long as they<lb/>
are eatable. Of course, on service, the niceties of method which we<lb/>
rightly adopt during peace, cannot always be adhered to, and some<lb/>
risks must be taken. Unless time and food are equally plentiful â and Feed<lb/>
this is not very often the case â the latter should be eaten Avhenever when you<lb/>
opportunity occurs, even with the prospect of immediate severe work : f5^<lb/>
it is better under the circumstances that some cAses of colic, and<lb/>
perhaps a death from ruptured stomach be risked, than the chance of a<lb/>
feed be missed, a chance which perhaps may not recur for many<lb/>
hours.
</p>

<p>
On the march the principle of feeding little and often should be The object<lb/>
adopted : at every halt of sufficient duration the nosebag should be put lesson of<lb/>
on. The London cab-horse is probably called upon to perform the ^^^ ^^^'<lb/>
most severe continuous daily work of any light horse in England ; at ^^'^'"^^â¢<lb/>
any moment he may be called on to trot at a fast pace, drawing a<lb/>
considerable load, for half an hour or an hour at a stretch ; and<lb/>
frequently during the day gets fast work for shorter periods. His<lb/>
nosebag is kept on constantly when at rest, and the plan answers<lb/>
admirably. At no time is the stomach overloaded, at no time is it quite<lb/>
empty. It is a method which, as far as possible, should be imitated<lb/>
on the march.
</p>

<p>
When marching long distances the portability of food becomes a Com-<lb/>
serious question, and compressed rations of various descriptions are pressed<lb/>
likely to be issued. Of whatever materials these consist they *o"*^s<lb/>
should be well broken up and, if possible, mixed with any procur-<lb/>
able fodder, which will give them bulk, e.g.^ chaff, chopped straw<lb/>
or grass ; and just previous to feeding they should be well damped<lb/>
as they are very dusty. Cocoa, biscuit, meal of any description, and Various<lb/>
even meat may be made use of ; and the addition of a few ounces of emer-<lb/>
sugar to a limited ration is a great help in sustaining horses engaged on p"fy<lb/>
a prolonged effort. The Turcomans were in the habit of giving their<lb/>
horses balls of meat, wheat meal and sugar in small quantities previous<lb/>
to and when engaged on raiis, and the natives of India make use of<lb/>
wheat flour in the same manner during long marches.

<p>
Horses<lb/>
towed<lb/>
after<lb/>
boats.
</p>

<p>
While, however, such articles may help in emergency, horses cannot<lb/>
maintain condition without sufficient bulk of food, and constant effort<lb/>
must be made to provide fodder of any description, in addition to grain<lb/>
rations.
</p>

<p>
During peace in all marches of five hours it is advisable to feed once<lb/>
e?i route, if possible immediately after the horses have had a good drink.<lb/>
The bit being removed, the nosebag is to be buckled well up, to allow<lb/>
the horse to reach the feed easily and prevent him tossing his head<lb/>
and spilling the grain. Half-way through the feed it may require<lb/>
readjusting for the same reason. Horses that toss their heads<lb/>
persistently should have the top of the bag tightened round the face<lb/>
by a rubber, cord, or strap, to prevent waste. When the horse ceases<lb/>
to feed he should be allowed to graze and the nosebag is to be turned<lb/>
inside out to dry.
</p>

<p>
Great care is to be taken to secure the mouths of all nosebags so that<lb/>
the contents may not be spilt on the way.
</p>

<p>
Swimming horses. â The horse is a pow^erful natural swimmer, and is<lb/>
capable of bearing a fully equipped man for a considerable distance.<lb/>
When afloat, the head is the only part visible, the body being just below<lb/>
the surface, and the tail awash behind.
</p>

<p>
If the rider remains mounted, his weight sinks the horse's body lower<lb/>
and he is himself immersed half way up the body at least. Swimming<lb/>
mounted requires a capable horseman, who should be a good swimmer<lb/>
himself. Before riding in, it is well to remove the portmouth bit if one<lb/>
is worn, and in guiding the horse when under way it is better to splash<lb/>
the side of his face and so head him up or down rather than pull on<lb/>
the reins.
</p>

<p>
Generally both men and horses are stripped and the kit ferried over<lb/>
dry. In this case the reins should be knotted, so that they will not<lb/>
entangle the forelegs when swimming. The men ride into the water<lb/>
till the horses are out of their depth and then slip off on the down stream<lb/>
side, holding to the mane or tail, and are towed over. The free hand is<lb/>
used to splash the horses' heads and make them keep their direction.<lb/>
According to the strength of the current, they should be headed more or<lb/>
less up stream, or they will be carried below the intended landing place.<lb/>
To guard against this, the place where the water is entered should be<lb/>
well up stream, and the landing should be wide, or a second suitable<lb/>
place should be available a little lower down.
</p>

<p>
If the horses are to be towed after boats, a rope is passed round the<lb/>
upper part of the neck and tied, with a knot which does not slip, just<lb/>
tight enough to prevent it coming over the head. The animal is then

driven into the water, and once afloat will follow the boat. If unwilling
</p>

<p>
to enter, splash water on the back. Particular care is to be taken to Do not
</p>

<p>
exert no traction on the neck-rope once the horse is swimming, or the pull on the
</p>

<p>
nostrils will be pulled under water and the animal may be drowned, l^ead.
</p>

<p>
For this reason the rope should be long, and the boat should be rowed
</p>

<p>
slowly. Three or four horses can be taken across at once, if they are not
</p>

<p>
troublesome.
</p>

<p>
Where the crossing is not wide and free from dangers, the horses can Swimming<lb/>
be driven in and swim across by themselves. The head ropes or snaffles horses<lb/>
should be knotted round the neck, so that the men wading in can secure ^^o"^-<lb/>
them as they land, and a picket boat should be placed down stream to<lb/>
keep them from losing direction. Some horses should be kept well in<lb/>
sight at the landing places, as an objective for those swimming, for it<lb/>
must be remembered that the animals' range of vision is very<lb/>
limited when the head is on a level with the water, and if they cannot<lb/>
see something familiar to make a point at, they are apt to go down<lb/>
stream.
</p>

<p>
In Camp.
</p>

<p>
Selection of Site. â Where the site of the camp has not been already Selection<lb/>
decided, choice should be made of ground flat enough to give a level of site,<lb/>
standing to the horses, but with sufficient natural fall to carry away storm<lb/>
water ; sheltered by higher ground from keen winds, and while within<lb/>
easy reach of the water supply, not draining into it, but below it.<lb/>
Marshy ground should be avoided always, but there are occasions when<lb/>
military conditions may preclude the avoidance of bad sites. The site<lb/>
chosen should be cleared of stones and other material which interferes<lb/>
with horses lying comfortably.
</p>

<p>
Water Supply. â When a stream is the source, the watering place will Position ot<lb/>
be below the men's drinking water, but above the washing place. It watering<lb/>
should be as near the camp as possible but above it ; have a sound bank pl^ce.<lb/>
and bottom ; wide approaches and exits ; be capable of watering as many<lb/>
horses as possible, and not liable to be fouled by upstream drainage or<lb/>
manufactories. If the bank is too steep, a ramp must be made. Steep<lb/>
extending as far as practicable the entire length. If the bank and banks,<lb/>
bottom are muddy, stones and gravel should be liberally used to make a Muddy<lb/>
firm, clean standing. Watering should always commence at the lowest ?treams.<lb/>
part of the allotted length of water, so that each succeeding batch . may catering<lb/>
procure a clean supply by entering a pace or two higher up. In watering, should be<lb/>
horses should be walked in single file across the river till its whole width carried

is occupied, their heads turned up stream to give them a clean drink, and<lb/>
when satisfied, they should turn about and leave at the lowest part for the<lb/>
reason given above.
</p>

<p>
Where the stream is too narrow or shallow, it can be widened or<lb/>
deepened as may be required by the construction of a dam, or by digging<lb/>
out the bottom.
</p>

<p>
Two horses only should be taken to water by each man, and bridoons<lb/>
or pelhams are to be used. The practice of sending four or five horses<lb/>
tied together under one man is objectionable ; it results in some of them<lb/>
not getting sufficient water, from being either hurried or disturbed in<lb/>
their drinking by the others to which they are tied.
</p>

<p>
If troughs are to be used a space of not less than one yard is<lb/>
necessary for each animal, and unless they are very broad it is not<lb/>
advisable to water from both sides at once, as though this economises<lb/>
time, the horses play with, and bite at each other, instead of drinking.<lb/>
It is better to allow the whole of the horses at the trough to quench their<lb/>
thirst before any fresh ones are permitted to approach, as the constant<lb/>
movement interferes with the more timid drinkers, and they do not fill<lb/>
themselves. Walking is the only pace to be permitted on the way to<lb/>
and from the troughs, and all noise and confusion should be avoided, as<lb/>
it excites horses, and they do not drink so freely as when quiet and<lb/>
undisturbed. When ready-made troughs are not available, they may be<lb/>
constructed of sods, and lined with tarpaulin.
</p>

<p>
Wateri)ig from pojids ox other stagnant pools maybe necessary, but<lb/>
it is to be avoided if another source is obtainable, for it is not possible to<lb/>
prevent such a supply being greatly fouled. Horses should not be<lb/>
allowed to walk into them further than necessary to reach the water<lb/>
easily, and if the place has to be used for any time, the edge should be<lb/>
regularly cleared of refuse. Vegetable scum and weed growing on the<lb/>
surface of such pools should not be cleared ; they help to keep the<lb/>
water pure, though their appearance may not be very inviting.
</p>

<p>
If the available accommodation makes it necessary for units to follow<lb/>
each other at the sanie watering place, a time table should be issued to<lb/>
prevent confusion.
</p>

<p>
Picketing. â By whatever method a horse is secured, it should be<lb/>
carried out in such a manner that he is not likely to injure himselt or his<lb/>
neighbour. The comfort of the animal should be studied as far as<lb/>
possible, but the prevention of injury is of the first importance. It is at<lb/>
the commencement of operations, and during peace manoeuvres, that this<lb/>
matter calls for most attention, as horses may be unused to the method,<lb/>
or so fresh that they attempt to bite or kick at each other. The first of

<p>
these reasons should not exist ; standing quietly under any form of Horses<lb/>
restraint which is likely to be imposed on a troop horse, being an should be<lb/>
essential part of a remount's training, and before his first experience of gt'^'^f<lb/>
camp life, he should be accustomed to head and heel ropes, foot- quietly,<lb/>
shackles, knee-haltering, linking, and standing alone. It is quite a<lb/>
simple matter of training, but if not taught before arrival in camp,<lb/>
a crop of perfectly avoidable accidents is the assured result. On<lb/>
peace manoeuvres, where horses are all well-fed and not overworked,<lb/>
there will always be a certain number of attempts to kick or bite, either<lb/>
in play or from vice ; both are equally serious in results, and the horse<lb/>
must be so secured as to prevent damage. On service, horses are<lb/>
usually too overworked and underfed to give much trouble in this<lb/>
respect, and are also more accustomed to the mode of life. The great How<lb/>
majority of injuries occur from the head and heel ropes being too long injuries<lb/>
and slack, and in practice this apparently simple matter requires ^^^i^'^-<lb/>
constant attention and supervision.
</p>

<p>
Picket lilies may consist of a single long rope, or the " built-up " Picket<lb/>
rope, a portion of which is carried by each man, and in either case they |j"^^'<lb/>
must be kept quite taut. They may be stretched along the ground, ^ "^J" "P<lb/>
or at a height of three to four feet from it. When heel ropes are not ^^^ ",
</p>

<p>
air
</p>

<p>
used, the latter is the better plan, as it prevents horses steppmg over jjj<lb/>
the line, and twisting their head ropes. The ends should be tied firmly<lb/>
to trees or wagon wheels, and kept as taut as possible. In standing<lb/>
camps a double set of lines, or a double set of heel-pegs on either side Double<lb/>
of the picket line should be arranged for. This permits a change of lines,<lb/>
standing when the ground is soiled or worn, and will be found a great<lb/>
convenience.
</p>

<p>
Head a?td heel ropes. â The head rope. First method of attaching to Head<lb/>
the head collar : Pass the point of the rope through the lower ring of the ^Â°P?^'<lb/>
backstrap of the head-collar, then through the ring at the end of the methods of<lb/>
head rope, and draw taut. Second method : Tie the head rope on to the ^^^^"^S-<lb/>
picket line securely, and the correct length. Taking the ringed end, pass<lb/>
a loop- of the rope through the lower ring of the backstrap of the head-<lb/>
collar ; slip the ring of the head rope through this loop, and draw the<lb/>
rope tight. This method does not slip, and can be released quickly,<lb/>
leaving the rope secure to the picket line \ it also ensures the head rope<lb/>
being the correct length.
</p>

<p>
Any knot by which the head rope is fastened to the picket line must Attach-<lb/>
be perfectly secure, and capable of being rapidly cast loose. The -knot "^^l^*^ to<lb/>
figured below has been employed with success. Tie the free end of the ^^^^^^<lb/>
head rope round the picket line in a half-bow (fig. 21), then pass the loop ^ "

tied together to make it this pattern. The proper lejtgth of a heel rope iheXcngth.<lb/>
is from the heel to the heel peg in a straight line, when the horse is of heel<lb/>
" standing up," with his head directly over the picket line or head peg, ropes,<lb/>
and no longer. The distance between the picket line and the heel pegs Distance<lb/>
may vary from three to five yards according to the size of the horse, between<lb/>
twelve to thirteen feet being sufficient for all ordinary size troop horses, head and<lb/>
A gangway of at least five yards width between the horses' heads should heel pegs,<lb/>
be left. The interval between horses depends upon the space available,<lb/>
the minimum being five feet.
</p>

<p>
Picketed according to the above directions, a horse can perform all<lb/>
movements necessary to his well-being, and cannot, as a rule, injure<lb/>
himself or his neighbours. Giving him further latitude is inviting<lb/>
disaster.
</p>

<p>
Shackles are of several patterns : â (i) A simple loop of leather which shackles,<lb/>
is passed over the foot, slipped round the pastern or above the fetlock, and<lb/>
secured there by a thong. This is an excellent pattern, may be adjusted<lb/>
tight or slack as required, and is not liable to cause injury itself.
</p>

<p>
(2) Straps and buckles^ sometimes lined with numnah to prevent straps and<lb/>
chafing, are of several different varieties. They all have one common buckles,<lb/>
fault, viz., the tongue of the buckle is likely to tear through the strap
</p>

<p>
holes, unless the leather is very strong and heavy. Where there is a<lb/>
guard under the buckle, to prevent it galling the skin, care must be taken<lb/>
not to double it under when adjusting. Numnah linings are not very<lb/>
satisfactory, they soak up wet, and retain gritty mud, which dries hard<lb/>
and rough.
</p>

<p>
(3) Hook a?2d eye pattern. â These fastenings are of metal, and are Hook<lb/>
attached to the leather work by rivets. No riveted fastenings are and eye<lb/>
satisfactory ; they are liable to work loose, and as the leather shrinks pattern,<lb/>
away from them, project on the inner side, and gall the skin. Metal<lb/>
hooks and eyes are so frequently strained or closed, that they either fall<lb/>
undone or become impossible to fasten.
</p>

<p>
(4) Button and eye pattern. â A loop of leather or webbing, one end of Button<lb/>
which is doubled into an eye, and the other gathered into a toggle or and eye<lb/>
button. So long as the button and loop fit well, this is a good pattern, pattern,<lb/>
but they are apt to stretch, get loose, and come undone too easily. A<lb/>
variety of this pattern, made of many strands of soft string (sootlee),
</p>

<p>
is a favourite shackle in India, particularly for young horses likely to be<lb/>
restive ; it is hght and soft, so does not hurt them, even if they struggle,<lb/>
but it does not wear very long.
</p>

<p>
A oood shackle of whatever pattern should present a smooth surface a good<lb/>
to the skin, have a secure fastening, and not be so heavy that its weight shackle,<lb/>

is likely to gall the skin of the heels when it rests upon them. They

<p>
must always be kept quite soft and pliable. Shackles may be worn

<p>
single one is worn, from leg to leg. When worn above the fetlocks they
</p>

<p>
are not to be tied so tight as to cause the legs to swell.
</p>

<p>
Pegs. Picket pegs may be used for the heel ropes only, or for fastening the
</p>

<p>
head ropes also, and where single horsemen are liable to be detached,
</p>

<p>
two pegs, or some method which renders them independent of others
</p>

<p>
is requisite. Many patterns of pegs have been tried, but none can be
</p>

<p>
considered perfect under all circumstances.
</p>

<p>
Fig. 23.
</p>

<p>
(i) Wooden pegs are usually shod and bound with iron, and provided<lb/>
with a rope or leathern loop, which facilitates the withdrawal of the peg<lb/>
from the ground. When not iron shod, wooden pegs must be periodically<lb/>
resharpened, as the points become frayed and blunt from driving.
</p>

<p>
(2) Iron pegs last longer than wooden ones, are easier to drive into<lb/>
the ground, but do not give such a secure hold when driven, and<lb/>
should they be accidentally pulled up, are more likely to inflict serious<lb/>
injury on the animal. On this account some iron pegs are made with a<lb/>
broad, heavy head beneath which the rope is tied ; if the peg is drawn,<lb/>
the weight of the head turns it point uppermost, and it slips out of the<lb/>
rope easily. Other patterns have a ring, or cross piece, for the<lb/>
attachment of the rope ; but for the reason just given, they are not<lb/>
such good designs.

<p>
(3) A spoon-shaped metal peg has also been tried. This has a Spoon-<lb/>
broad curved end, with an opening in the centre ; a hole is dug with ^^^^^P^"<lb/>
the blade ; a small bundle of twigs is placed through the opening ; the ^^^'''<lb/>
peg is buried, and the earth well-stamped in. It is said to give a very<lb/>
firm hold.
</p>

<p>
Pegs should always be driven at an angle with the ground, with the Driving<lb/>
point towards the animal, and to their full extent. If the soil is of such P^^'^-,<lb/>
a light nature that the pegs draw easily, two pegs, one behind the ^^^ ^<lb/>
other, will increase the holding power. The further peg should be ^ ^ "<lb/>
quite buried in the ground, as shown in the figure. (Fig. 23.)
</p>

<p>
When no pegs are available, a bundle of twigs should be tied at the Method ot<lb/>
end of the head rope, and buried crosswise at a depth of one to two feet securing
</p>

<p>
according to the nature of the soil, and the earth well-stamped in.<lb/>
This will give a very firm hold.
</p>

<p>
without<lb/>
pegs.
</p>

<p>
Fig. 24.
</p>

<p>
If it is necessary to picket horses by a head rope only, this may "Swivel<lb/>
get much twisted by the animal walking round and round. A makeshift on head<lb/>
swivel to prevent this may be provided by a tent rope fid. (Fig. 24.) ^^P^-
</p>

<p>
The most frequent and serious cause of injury to horses picketed by Rope<lb/>
head and heel ropes is from getting their hind feet over the head rope or galls,<lb/>
picket line. Horses that feel any irritation about the head and neck,<lb/>
scratch themselves with their hind feet ; if the head and heel ropes are<lb/>
not sufficiently tight, they can bend the head round, and reach up a<lb/>
hind foot to meet it for the purpose.
</p>

<p>
In doing this the foot not infrequently slips over the head rope or<lb/>
picket line, and finding himself pinioned, the animal struggles in the<lb/>
wildest way, gets cast, and before he can be released, may, and some-<lb/>
times does, inflict a three or four months' injury upon himself. It is better<lb/>
that he should be securely tied, even if this compels him to undergo-some<lb/>
shght discomfort rather than be given the opportunity to put himself out<lb/>
of action at a time when his services are most needed.

ANIMAL MANAGEMENT.

<p>
Methods of<lb/>
restraint.
</p>

<p>
Other methods of securing. â A swinging picket is occasionally used by<lb/>
officers for their chargers, and is made by running a head rope with log<lb/>
attached through a swivel or movable ring on the top of a picket post<lb/>
between three and four feet high. If this plan is adopted, the head rope<lb/>
must be no longer than previously described, and the log quite heavy<lb/>
enough to take back the slack when the horse changes his position.
</p>

<p>
Another method is to employ a smooth pole six or seven feet high, with<lb/>
a loose ring, of larger diameter than the pole, fixed by a short strap to the<lb/>
cheek piece of the head collar. The ring is placed over the pole, up and<lb/>
down which it slides as the animal's head is raised and lowered. It is a<lb/>
useful way of securing a biter, as it limits the movement of the head, while<lb/>
permitting all necessary freedom.
</p>

<p>
A double head rope is often used with the object of gaining extra<lb/>
security or limiting the side movements of the head. A peg is driven two<lb/>
or three feet on each side of the horse's head, and a rope fixed to each<lb/>
from the cheek pieces of the head collar. It is a favourite method in India,<lb/>
and a suitable one where stallions have to be dealt with.
</p>

<p>
A single foot shackle., fastened on the pastern of one fore foot, and<lb/>
attached to a peg by a short length of rope or chain, is a convenient way<lb/>
for single horsemen, on detached duty, to secure their mounts. The peg<lb/>
must be driven flush with the ground, or it will prevent the horse lying<lb/>
down without risk of injury ; the plan makes each man independent,<lb/>
and the necessary equipment is portable and light. It has been said that<lb/>
horses so tied are likely to strain their pasterns, but the assertion cannot<lb/>
be sustained by fact, and once they are accustomed to it animals so<lb/>
secured stand as quietly as with any other mode.
</p>

<p>
The movements of horses may be restricted in several ways, all of<lb/>
which are occasionally useful in camp, but in order to employ them with<lb/>
safety and success it is necessary that the animals should be used to such<lb/>
methods of restraint, or confusion, and possibly accident will result.<lb/>
Where stallions are to be dealt with, they are not always applicable.
</p>

<p>
(i) Coupling when saddled. â Place the horse's head to tail ; tie<lb/>
the reins of each round the back stay of the rear arch of the other's<lb/>
saddle.
</p>

<p>
(2) Heads in a circle. â This can be carried out<lb/>
(i) by tying the head rope of each to the head collar of the next until
</p>

<p>
a complete circle is formed ;<lb/>
(ii) by tying each head rope to a metal ring about 18 inches in dia-<lb/>
meter carried for the purpose. Fodder can be placed in the<lb/>
centre, and as no two horses pull in the same direction they<lb/>
remain stationary.

<p>
(3) K72ee halterino. â The head rope is carried from the lower ring of Knee<lb/>
the backstay of the head collar to the forearm just above the knee, where haltering,<lb/>
it is tied just tight enough to prevent it slipping down the leg. The best
</p>

<p>
knot for the purpose is a clove hitch, with a half hitch as a keeper, to stop<lb/>
it slipping. With horses accustomed to the method, the rope maybe tied<lb/>
loosely below the knee, or round the pastern. The length of rope required<lb/>
is enough to let the horse get his mouth on the ground and no more.<lb/>
Even with this small amount of liberty, some can travel at a surprising<lb/>
pace when being caught. Knee haltering is the best method of securing<lb/>
horses at graze, and they are easily accustomed to the restraint it entails,<lb/>
though they may resent it at first.
</p>

<p>
(4) Hobbles may be used to connect a fore and hind, or both forelegs, Hobbles,<lb/>
the amount of movement possible being regulated by the length of the
</p>

<p>
rope connecting the hobbles.
</p>

<p>
Thin horses should be placed at the end of the line next the Thin<lb/>
forage. Worses.
</p>

<p>
Vicious animals are better apart from others, as they disturb them when Vicious<lb/>
feeding and resting. Sacks of sand may be tied to the heel ropes of animals,<lb/>
kickers in lieu of pegs, and this sometimes stops the habit.
</p>

<p>
Cribbcrs should be secured by a foot shackle only, so that they have Cribbers.<lb/>
.nothing to bite upon.
</p>

<p>
Feeding. â The general principles of feeding should be adhered to as Feeding,<lb/>
far as circumstances allow, and the special notes on feeding on the march<lb/>
are also applicable to life in camp (see p. 138) ; it is only necessary here<lb/>
to add details not previously given.
</p>

<p>
Hay. â The use of hay nets should be universal ; without them, hay, Hay nets,<lb/>
always wasteful, becomes doubly so in wet and windy weather. The<lb/>
mesh should be such a size that a small quantity only can be pulled out at<lb/>
once, and they should be secured to the picket line by each end. If nets<lb/>
are not to be had, hay should be fed in small quantity, and frequently<lb/>
renewed, each fresh supply being tucked under the picket line. This is<lb/>
very necessary in prolonged wet weather, and if the rain is not con-<lb/>
tinuous, it is better to withhold hay altogether till the shower is over.
</p>

<p>
To avoid waste, trusses of hay should only be broken as they are<lb/>
actually required, and should be carried to the horses before this is done.<lb/>
The tilt of a wagon may be used for mixing feeds and for covering the<lb/>
forage when not in use.
</p>

<p>
Chaff should be used as much as possible when it can be got. The Chaff,<lb/>
place where it is chopped must be well protected from wind, by sod<lb/>
banks, hurdles, or tarpauhn stretched round posts. If the hay supply is<lb/>
large the trusses can be arranged round the chaff machine for this purpose.

ANIMAL MANAGEMENT.
</p>

<p>
Nosebags. Nosebags require frequent cleaning ; they should be removed as soon
</p>

<p>
as the horse has done feeding, and turned inside out to dry. Patterns<lb/>
which have a wide bottom are to be preferred to narrow ones, as the<lb/>
feed gets caked in the ends of the latter. Special large bags are used<lb/>
where chaff or hay cake is fed, and a very useful substitute may be made<lb/>
from a sack.
</p>

<p>
Grazing. Gj'azing should be afforded at every opportunity, and for this
</p>

<p>
purpose knee-hobbling is the best plan to adopt. The horses should not<lb/>
be herded in a ring, but allowed to gradually advance over the grazing<lb/>
ground. The horse guard should take their own horses saddled, so that<lb/>
they can rapidly round up the mob when required.
</p>

<p>
Grooming. Groommg. â Except for the removal of mud and dirt, horses in camp do<lb/>
not require so much brushing as when stabled, since, owing to exposure,<lb/>
the skin is not so active, changes in it are not so great, and scurf does not<lb/>
accumulate so fast, whilst the slight extra greasiness which will be present<lb/>
is a natural protection against cold. On the other hand, a good wisping<lb/>
stimulates the general circulation, increases the output of the oil glands,<lb/>
and produces a comfortable warmth in the skin which cannot but be<lb/>
appreciated by the animal and always improves the appearance.
</p>

<p>
Clothing. Clothing. â When rugs are used they should be secured round both
</p>

<p>
breast and quarters ; the latter is especially necessary, or the sheets blow<lb/>
over the horses' heads and may stampede them, in addition to depriving<lb/>
them of the desired warmth. Surcingles shrink rapidly when wet, and<lb/>
must not be strapped tightly at night or when raining ; a dewy night will<lb/>
shrink them as much as a shower. Neglect of this precaution will cause<lb/>
sores from the increased pressure of the pad on the back. When the<lb/>
weather is wet but warm, the horses are better without clothing ; but if<lb/>
the wind is bitter and the rain cold, blankets may be left on. Rain does<lb/>
not hurt horses, the grease of the skin renders it waterproof, but if the<lb/>
wind is cold as well, it tells on their condition, unless they get extra food.<lb/>
Profcction from ^ueaiJier. â In cold, wet, and windy weather, horses<lb/>
hke to stand with their tails to it, and will try and screw themselves<lb/>
round if not so placed ; but in mild or hot weather they should be head<lb/>
to the breeze.
</p>

<p>
Wind screens may be easily made of turf walls or tall, wattled hurdles,<lb/>
placed to windward of the lines, but roofed shelters of a temporary nature<lb/>
should not be erected for this purpose unless they can be so solidly con-<lb/>
structed as to be quite safe in any storm, or grave loss may result.
</p>

<p>
Pi-otectioji fj-om the sim is desirable in very hot countries, and in this<lb/>
case any light structure may be employed as shelter during the day,<lb/>
while the horses can be constantly watched and quickly removed. At

MANAGEMENT OF HORSES IN THE OPEN. I51

<p>
night they should be picketed in the open. The shade of trees can be<lb/>
utiHzed if flies are not too troublesome, and the numnah or blanket may<lb/>
be placed over the loins.
</p>

<p>
Horses stand dry heat better than damp, and the amount of exertion Effect of<lb/>
they are capable of undergoing in hot countries is much affected by the damp heat,<lb/>
quantity of moisture in the atmosphere. If it is great, there is profuse<lb/>
sweating, even when standing under cover, and over-exertion is liable to<lb/>
bring on heat stroke. Great judgment should therefore be shown when<lb/>
working horses under such conditions, and every opportunity given them<lb/>
to assuage their thirst.
</p>

<p>
Eye fri7iges are very useful, both as a protection from sun and flies. Eye<lb/>
They may be made of lea:ther or string, and buttoned or stitched on to fringes,<lb/>
the browband. Detachable fringes of string are the most convenient;<lb/>
they do not get hard and curly from .exposure to sun, like the leather<lb/>
ones, and they can be removed for cleaning.
</p>

<p>
Stampedes. â Horses are liable to panic, and may stampede for what Stam-<lb/>
appear to be very trivial causes. Sudden storms and noises of any pedes,<lb/>
nature, thunder, lightning, hail, rifle shots ; the presence of loose horses,<lb/>
especially stallions ; wild animals passing through the camp, swarms of<lb/>
bees or flies, and grass fires in the vicinity are all known causes, but on<lb/>
other occasions the reason has not been apparent. If a large body of<lb/>
horses suddenly dash in one direction, probably nothing will hold them ;<lb/>
but a strict supervision over the picketing, and the presence of the men<lb/>
at the horses' heads, when the occasion can be foreseen, are the best<lb/>
means of averting the disaster. The loosing of horses on the way to<lb/>
and from the watering place is to be prohibited, and stray animals of<lb/>
every sort should be prevented from entering the camp.
</p>

<p>
The sanitation of the liiies demands constant attention. The natural The<lb/>
lie of the ground should be taken advantage of to get rid of storm sanitation<lb/>
drainage, and small clean cut drains made in suitable directions to assist in<lb/>
its rapid removal. All rubbish should be cleared from the lines, and the<lb/>
standings kept quite level, in order that the horses may take a proper<lb/>
amount of rest, which they will not do if the ground is very uneven. For<lb/>
this purpose the free use of sand will be found of advantage ; it fills in<lb/>
the hollows which are inevitable when the camp is occupied for any time,<lb/>
soaks up urine and keeps the lines dry. Dung and other refuse is to be Dung<lb/>
removed regularly, and to a considerable distance from the lines, as it heaps,<lb/>
attracts flies, and is one of their favourite breeding places. The refuse<lb/>
pits or heaps should be down stream from the camp, to avoid any chance<lb/>
of contammating the water supply, and for similar reasons, the disposal Carcases,<lb/>
of dead animals is to be carried out in the same direction.

CHAPTER VII.
</p>

<p>
SADDLES AND SORE BACKS.<lb/>
The Structure of the Back.
</p>

<p>
Saddle EXCLUDING epizootic diseases, it would be difficult to find any cause<lb/>
injury a of inefficiency among army horses equal to that produced by saddle<lb/>
cause of injuries. It has always been so, for the reason that insufficient attention<lb/>
large j^g^g bggn paid to the question of prevention, and few realize the extra-
</p>

<p>
fneffici- Â° ordinary damage which may be inflicted in a very short time by an ill-<lb/>
ency. fitting saddle or collar.
</p>

<p>
It is quite reasonable, in the face of past experience, to ask the question<lb/>
whether the class of injury we are about to deal with can be prevented<lb/>
to any great extent, or whether it is not one of the penalties we pay for<lb/>
having domesticated the horse?
</p>

<p>
We can dismiss the question at once, it is a common, but not always<lb/>
necessary penalty ; and its frequency is enormously increased by<lb/>
ignorance, indifference and want of intelligence, singly or combined.
</p>

<p>
In the ordinary course of things, it was not intended that horses should<lb/>
carry a weight or pull a load, or some special protection would have<lb/>
been given them, whereas the construction of the back is such that it lends<lb/>
itself to injury, and invites trouble by the very peculiarity and delicacy<lb/>
of its organization.
</p>

<p>
In fact, it may at once be stated, as our text throughout this chapter,<lb/>
that the basis of a sound scheme for the prevention of injuries from<lb/>
saddles and harness can only be laid down by a knowledge of the<lb/>
structure of the parts. All else is guess work. There is probably no<lb/>
other branch of animal management where a knowledge of the structure<lb/>
of the body is so essential to a clear conception of the subject.<lb/>
The spine. The spine is composed of a chain of bones, each link moving on the<lb/>
one in front of and behind it. It is true the movement is limited, but small<lb/>
as it is, it is of the utmost importance.
</p>

<p>
The movements of the spinal chain are upwards, downwards and from<lb/>
side to side ; these may be easily illustrated ; the spine arches upwards<lb/>
when a horse " buck jumps," or backs, it becomes depressed under the

<p>
influence of weight, it moves from side to side when an animal turns to<lb/>
the right or left, and especially in the "bending" lessons of the riding<lb/>
school.
</p>

<p>
Knit closely together as are the eighteen links comprising the back,<lb/>
yet it may be readily appreciated,' from the above fact, that this movement<lb/>
on each other, slight as it is, is of supreme importance.
</p>

<p>
When we come to speak of the weight which horses are capable of<lb/>
carrying, the necessity for spinal movement must not be lost sight of, as<lb/>
influencing the question.
</p>

<p>
The spine is distinctly arched, it rises from the neck bones, and falls<lb/>
again towards the hind quarters. The object of this arched arrange-<lb/>
ment is to secure strength, and is infinitely more marked in the<lb/>
spinal column of man than in that of the horse. Man from his con-<lb/>
struction is essentially devised for carrying weight, for in this respect<lb/>
a vertical spine is far stronger than one which is horizontal, the arch-like<lb/>
construction is also more marked, while finally some of the individual<lb/>
links in a man's spine are actually larger than those of the horse.
</p>

<p>
The back and loins are frequently mixed up in the mind of the Back and<lb/>
ordinary person, but it is essential for our purpose that they should be loins,<lb/>
sharply differentiated. The back bones extend from the last bone of the<lb/>
neck to the last rib ; the loins lie between the last rib and the quarters.<lb/>
It is true that a great deal of the backbone is out of sight, being covered<lb/>
by the blade bones ; the portion of back which is visible reaches from the<lb/>
play of the blade bone to the last rib, and this is the part which is of so<lb/>
much interest in saddle fitting.
</p>

<p>
At this point it is desirable to compare what has been stated with<lb/>
fig. 25, which shows the skeleton of the trunk, the arching of the<lb/>
spine from the root of the neck to the hind quarters, and the amount of<lb/>
the back which is hidden by the blade bone.
</p>

<p>
A reference to this figure shows that throughout the whole length of Bony<lb/>
the spine may be seen a bony process which grows from the upper part processes<lb/>
of each link in the chain. The processes in front are very long, and their ^^^^^<lb/>
summit forms the withers ; those behind are short and broad ; the front<lb/>
processes look backwards, those behind look forwards.
</p>

<p>
The upper part of the bony processes form the ridge of the backbone. The ridge<lb/>
They do not represent the spine proper (the links of which are more 9^ ^^9^<lb/>
deeply seated), but they represent the only part of the spine which can be backbone,<lb/>
examined and felt, and they are the seat of all the bone trouble which may<lb/>
be found in a bad sore back.
</p>

<p>
The subject will be alluded to again, but the fact cannot be learned<lb/>
too early, that these bony processes are not intended to bear weight ;

<p>
they represent, as we have expressed it above, the only part of the spine<lb/>
which can be examined and felt, but the spine proper is deep-seated and<lb/>
covered with flesh.
</p>

<p>
If the bony processes belonging to the spine are exposed to pressure,<lb/>
even be it ever so slight, the parts at once become inflamed.
</p>

<p>
A reference to fig. 25 shows the ribs apparently growing out from the<lb/>
backbone ; as a matter of fact the head of each rib is let into a joint<lb/>
formed between every link in the spinal chain, and the object of this joint<lb/>
is to allow the ribs to move. The diagram also shows that the ribs in

False ribs, front are let into the breastbone, while those behind are lashed, as it were,<lb/>
to each other. These latter are called the false ribs. The former let<lb/>
into the breastbone are the true ribs.
</p>

<p>
The true ribs are stout and straight, the false are thinner and curved.<lb/>
The curving and arching of the ribs increases from front to rear, so that<lb/>
the chest is narrowest between the two front ribs, and widest between the<lb/>
two last.
</p>

<p>
This progressive increase in the width of a horse from front to rear is<lb/>
best seen by looking down on the back from above (fig. 26), when the<lb/>
wedge-shaped appearance becomes very apparent. Fig. 27 shows a vertical

Saddle<lb/>
rests on<lb/>
the ribs.
</p>

<p>
When a saddle is placed on the back, it rests on the ribs ; it is on the<lb/>
ribs, and not on the spine, that the weight is actually carried. This<lb/>
fundamental fact must early be committed to memory, it is the basis of<lb/>
all saddle fitting. The rear ribs carry the weight on their upper surface,<lb/>
and may be seen indicated by the dotted line of fig. 28. The front ribs

being stouter, and fixed into the breastbone, can carry weight not only on<lb/>
their upper surface, but also on their side (fig. 27) ; if it were not for their<lb/>
being fixed into the breastbone, a girth could not be used.
</p>

<p>
Turning now to the loins, we find this part is composed of five b^ies,<lb/>
which in several respects resemble the links of the backbone, but they<lb/>
are larger, and have growing out from them at right angles a thin

long process such as the backbone does not possess, but there are no ribs.<lb/>
On the length of the transverse processes just described depends the<lb/>
width of the loins. A horse which is narrow in the loins cannot Loins<lb/>
carry weight. Yet the loins are not intended to support weight, no "^Â° "Â°'<lb/>

shall be alluded to later ; but the point which we here wish to emphasise<lb/>
is that in spite of the fact that the bones of the loins are larger and<lb/>
stouter than the bones of the back, they are not intended to carry<lb/>
weight.
</p>

<p>
The forelegs of the horse are not fitted to the body by means of a Attach-<lb/>

</p>

<p>
muscle. The trunk is therefore skmg between the forelegs, and<lb/>
in this respect differs considerably from the hind legs, which are<lb/>
secured to the body by muscles, and a large cup and ball joint.<lb/>
The muscles which fix the forelegs to the body are plastered over the<lb/>
sides of the ribs to which they are firmly attached ; the upper bone of the<lb/>
foreleg, the so-called blade bone, is shaped something like a fan in order<lb/>
to lie flat on the'surface of the ribs.
</p>

<p>
When the foreleg moves the blade bone moves ; its range of motion<lb/>
being greater near the shoulder joint than above ; the movement of the<lb/>
blade bone is forwards and backwards, but if figs. 29, 30, and 31 be looked at,<lb/>
it will be easy to observe that while the handle of the fan is going forward,<lb/>
the fan itself is travelling backwards and vice versa^ the movement is on<lb/>
the same principle as a see-saw.
</p>

<p>
Attention must be paid to this fact, as it will be apparent from an<lb/>
inspection of figs. 29-31 that if the blade bone is travelhng to and fro,<lb/>
nothing which is placed on the back in the form of a saddle should ever<lb/>
press upon it or interfere with its movements, otherwise the length<lb/>
and safety of the horse's stride will at once be affected. So vital is this<lb/>
question that we shall refer to it in greater detail in dealing with the use<lb/>
and function of the different parts of the back.
</p>

<p>
On referring to figs. 27, 28, it will be obvious that the triangular space<lb/>
Avhich lies between the processes of tlie vertebrie, and the ribs must in<lb/>
the living animal be filled up with flesh or, as we shall prefer to call it,<lb/>
muscle. A large slab of muscle runs the whole length of the back ;<lb/>
beginning at the loins it fills up the triangular space formed by these<lb/>
vertebrse, and continuing its way along the back fills up the space<lb/>
between the vertebrae and ribs. It is on this muscle that the saddle rests ;<lb/>
from a saddle fitting point of view it is the most important muscle of the<lb/>
body. Fig. 32 shows the superficial muscles of the back after the skin<lb/>
has been removed.
</p>

<p>
The use of muscles is to bring about movement, and those which<lb/>
lie along the back have for their special function the lifting of the fore<lb/>
part of the body, as for example in jumping. This, of course, is an<lb/>
exaggerated example of the use of the muscles of the back and loins,<lb/>
but conveys the correct idea of the fore part of the body being lifted ;<lb/>
this lifting, though only to a slight extent as compared with the above, is<lb/>
constantly occurring during progression, and maintains the proper<lb/>
equilibrium of the body.
</p>

<p>
If the skin be dissected off the back (fig. 32) the muscles do not at once<lb/>
come into view ; beneath the skin is a thin, tough, yellow elastic layer of<lb/>
material which spreads like a sheet over the loins and back and envelops the

<p>
muscles, which il hides from view. It is there for the purpose of additional ^""i^^^^!<lb/>
strength, but it is this layer of material which contributes so considerably diniculties<lb/>
to the surgical difficulties in treating bad backs, as it prevents matter ^acks*^<lb/>
pointing to the surface while affording it every facility for burrowing in<lb/>
all directions. It is true this point is only of interest to the surgeon, but<lb/>
the horseman would do well to bear in mind that injuries to the back,<lb/>
from the very anatomical arrangements of the part, all tend naturally to<lb/>
get worse instead of better, and are from the beginning complex, slowly<lb/>
healing injuries which cannot be hurried iij their cure.
</p>

<p>
Up to this point we have described the bones and muscles of the<lb/>
back, we have now to clothe the part with skin, and deal in an<lb/>
elementary way with the structural peculiarities of the latter.
</p>

<p>
There are two skins, an outer composed of scales possessing very skin<lb/>
little sensation and no blood, and an inner which is highly sensitive and of back,<lb/>
full of blood-vessels. There are many other differences between the<lb/>
inner and outer skin, but for our purpose these distinctions are<lb/>
sufficient.
</p>

<p>
Owing to the hair and the colour of the skin the blood can rarely be<lb/>
seen in a horse's skin the same as it can in a man's ; but it is there,<lb/>
flushing the parts now more, now less, depending on the temperature and<lb/>
other local conditions. It is only in the pink skin of horses with white<lb/>
heels that the blood-vessels can be seen, giving the part, especially under<lb/>
the influence of exercise, the bright, ruddy appearance seen in the active<lb/>
â kin of a man at work. The vessels in the skin which carry the blood<lb/>
are hair-like in diameter and innumerable. Their structure is so delicate<lb/>
that very little pressure is sufficient to keep the parts empty, as can be<lb/>
easily demonstrated on one's hand ; the white mark which follows<lb/>
temporary pressure on the back of the hand is due to the minute blood-<lb/>
vessels being emptied of their blood ; as soon as the blood once more enters<lb/>
the white mark disappears. The influence of this question of blood in the<lb/>
skin will later on be fully dealt with.
</p>

<p>
The outer or scaly covering of the skin is mainly for the purpose of Friction<lb/>
protection, protects the delicate parts beneath, and as it gets worn away may cause<lb/>
by friction is replaced from below. Ordinarily the production of scales is galls,<lb/>
equal to the wear and tear, but when friction causes wear and tear to<lb/>
predominate over production, injury arises and the sensitive parts<lb/>
beneath are then exposed. A rub to a back, a gall to a shoulder, are<lb/>
illustrations of excess of wear and tear over production, and represent<lb/>
the simplest form of gall.
</p>

<p>
spine is situated, it is evident that the curve of the spine is represented by<lb/>
the bony processes previously described. When these are short, the back<lb/>
tends towards flatness, as in the donkey, when they are long, the withers<lb/>
are high and the ridge of the back prominent. These processes also<lb/>
determine the slope of the withers, long processes mean high withers,<lb/>
low processes mean thick low withers. The slope of back enormously<lb/>
influences the production of injury, and nowhere is this better seen than<lb/>
in the case of the withers. No horse with high lean withers should find<lb/>
its way into the Service for sad(lle purposes, and the opposite extreme of<lb/>
low thick withers is nearly, though not quite, so objectionable.
</p>

<p>
Long backs are a source of weakness, and as a rule they are poorly<lb/>
developed, while their length is in itself a weakness ; such backs are<lb/>
frequently associated with long narrow loins, one of the greatest faults a<lb/>
troop horse can possess. The loins can hardly be too short and can<lb/>
never be too wide.
</p>

<p>
Backs vary so much in shape as any other part of the body ; if<lb/>
careful measurements are made it is surprising how few have the same<lb/>
shape and size of back, yet a broad classification of backs may be made ;<lb/>
here, for instance, is a table in which the extremes are shown : â<lb/>
High withers. Low withers.
</p>

<p>
Short backs. Long backs.
</p>

<p>
Hollow backs. Roach backs.
</p>

<p>
Wide backs. Narrow backs.
</p>

<p>
And between these extremes any degree may be met.
</p>

<p>
A short back is a sign of strength, it is associated with a short wide<lb/>
loin, and provided the back is long enough for the saddle, the broad<lb/>
general statement may be made that it cannot be too short.
</p>

<p>
A long back is a weak back, it is associated with long weak loins and<lb/>
flat ribs, and its muscles are usually poorly developed.
</p>

<p>
High withers are generally associated with good action and front, but<lb/>
when excessively high it is not uncommon to find the back hollow, and<lb/>
such a one is unfit to carry weight under military conditions. High<lb/>
withers are always lean, narrow, and razor like ; the horse that possesses<lb/>
them is always in danger of injury, for, as we have previously mentioned,<lb/>
the ridge of the back, which includes the withers, is perfectly incapable<lb/>
of sustaining pressure.
</p>

<p>
Low withers may be associated with low, clumsy action ; when<lb/>
the withers are very low there is a compensation present in their width,<lb/>
they are always very wide. A wide wither is nearly as troublesome as a<lb/>
high one, not for the reason that it gets pressed upon, but owing to the<lb/>
fact that it is liable to be pinched.

SADDLIS AND SORE BACKS. l6l
</p>

<p>
Hollow backs are associated with high withers and high loins. It is Hollow<lb/>
a useless back for a military horse, as owing to its curve the saddle is backs,<lb/>
unable to get a level bed on the back, and only the front and rear<lb/>
extremities bear on the back, with the result that injury follows.
</p>

<p>
A roach back is the converse of a hollow one, it is always a sign of Roach<lb/>
great strength ; but as the hollow back is very comfortable for the rider, back,<lb/>
the roach back is most uncomfortable, and such a horse may soon tire a<lb/>
man out.
</p>

<p>
Wide backs are those which possess a good arch to the ribs and afford Wide<lb/>
a good wide bed for the saddle to rest on ; it is an essential formation backs,<lb/>
for a soldier's horse, though excessive width must be avoided, as the<lb/>
saddle will work forward on to the neck.
</p>

<p>
Narrow backs are due to ribs possessing defective curvature ; the ribs Narrow<lb/>
are too straight, and in consequence there is very little bearing surface backs,<lb/>
for the saddle, and what back there is has a slope like the roof of a house,<lb/>
while the sides are flat. A flat-sided horse, besides carrying his saddle<lb/>
badly, is deficient in stamina and soon succumbs to fatigue.
</p>

<p>
The appearance of muscle generally and how it is strengthened I\[uscles of<lb/>
has been previously described (see p. 5\ and the muscles of the back back in<lb/>
(fig. 32) are now specially considered, not from the point of view of [^ j^fie<lb/>
the anatomist or surgeon but frorh that of the hygienist. fitting
</p>

<p>
A saddle must not rest directly on any of the hard structure of the<lb/>
back, be it spine or ribs : it must only rest on those parts well clothed<lb/>
with muscle, and the only part of the back so clothed is the angular space<lb/>
formed by the ribs and processes of the vertebrae (see figs. 27, 28) ;<lb/>
the dotted line represents where the saddle should bear.
</p>

<p>
In saddle fitting the muscles of the back act as a buffer to the bones Muscles<lb/>
beneath, and so prevent injury ; where a part of the back has no a buffer<lb/>
muscle to protect it, there the saddle cannot rest, or, if it does, injury ^Â° bones,<lb/>
results.
</p>

<p>
The importance of having well-nourished back muscles is very great ;<lb/>
where they are large and well developed we may be certain the parts<lb/>
beneath are sufficiently protected, where they are impoverished and weak<lb/>
the animal is in hourly risk of injury.
</p>

<p>
W^hen horses are working hard and underfed, one of the first places Back<lb/>
to show muscle waste is the back. The muscles, previously convex, now shows<lb/>
become concave until well-marked gullies form along either side of ^^^^^J^<lb/>
the spine, while the ribs previously hidden are now in view and can<lb/>
be distinctly counted.
</p>

<p>
The whole shape of the back is altered ; it is as if some new structure Changes

<p>
had taken the place of the old, and all this is explained by the in shape

<p>
melting of the muscles on the back bringing the skeleton beneath into<lb/>
view.
</p>

<p>
It is this metamorphosis of the back which has to be so anxiously<lb/>
watched on service. It is this which renders all previous saddle fittings<lb/>
useless, for the impoverished back is as different from the well-nourished<lb/>
one as anything can possibly be ; it is as though we compared the<lb/>
skeleton to the living subject.
</p>

<p>
We dwell upon and emphasise this question of back muscle ; it is the
</p>

<p>
foundation of a clear conception of sore backs and their causes, and it is
</p>

<p>
the basis of all preventive measures.
</p>

<p>
Effect of We have previously mentioned something of the structure of the skin,
</p>

<p>
pressure but have now to deal with certain features in its construction which
</p>

<p>
Â°U" f influence, to a considerable degree, the production of sore backs. We
</p>

<p>
the"back have described the blood-vessels in the skin and how readily pressure
</p>

<p>
acts in keeping these vessels empty ; the illustration which was given
</p>

<p>
being the white mark on the back of the hand after pressure with a finger.
</p>

<p>
The lay mind does not readily grasp the fact that quite a considerable<lb/>
portion of the blood of the body is circulating in the skin, and that one<lb/>
object of this is to ensure the rapid renewal of the skin, which being<lb/>
exposed to friction, would soon wear away to the sensitive parts unless<lb/>
constantly replaced. There are other functions the blood and the skin<lb/>
performs, but these are not germane to our subject and may be<lb/>
neglected.
</p>

<p>
If the blood supply of any part of the body be cut off, the part dies.<lb/>
Whether it dies rapidly or slowly depends upon the thoroughness with<lb/>
which the blood stream has been cut off; if complete, the death of the<lb/>
part will only be a matter of a few hours, if incomplete it may take a few<lb/>
days. This statement holds good whether it be the question of a limb or<lb/>
a small piece of skin on the back.
</p>

<p>
Pressure will kill any of the tissues of the body ; a leg may be<lb/>
completely amputated, skin, muscles, and bone, without the use of a knife<lb/>
or sawâ a simple piece of elastic cord will do in the course of weeks<lb/>
what a knife can do in a minute or two. The pressure of the cord cuts<lb/>
off the blood supply, the part dies, and is gradually cast off.
</p>

<p>
The limb amputated by an elastic cord is an exaggerated example of<lb/>
the influence of pressure ; for the purpose of the subject we are<lb/>
considering we have not to think of any pressure greater than that<lb/>
produced by a man's weight, or any structure to die as the result of<lb/>
this pressure other than those found in the back.
</p>

<p>
The skin of the horse's back is subjected to pressure when the man<lb/>
mounts, and in consequence less blood circulates through it than before.
</p>

			<p>
SADDLES AND SORE BACKS. 1 63
</p>

<p>
The greater the weight imposed the greater the pressure on the skin,<lb/>
and with every increase in pressure less blood is circulating through it.
</p>

<p>
It is safe to say that the pressure is never quite the same at any two<lb/>
points over the back ; it is greater here and less there, depending upon<lb/>
the fit of the saddletree, so that we never expect to see the whole length<lb/>
of the skin of the back die as the result of pressure, but only those<lb/>
parts where the tree has been particularly ill-fitting and the pressure the<lb/>
greatest.
</p>

<p>
It is obvious that so long as there is a good deep muscle bed beneath<lb/>
the skin the chances of completely cutting off the blood supply are very<lb/>
small ; a? the muscle becomes reduced in bulk the saddle is brought<lb/>
day by day nearer to the skeleton, and the unyielding saddle on the<lb/>
one hand and rigid bone on the other very soon complete the destruction<lb/>
of the skin.
</p>

<p>
The muscle of the back may be regarded in the light of so much<lb/>
extra stuffing in the saddle, it saves the bones and skin from injury ;<lb/>
it takes the jar and concussion, and forms an elastic cushion for the<lb/>
saddle to rest on.
</p>

<p>
This point having now been made clear it is easy to understand<lb/>
the harm which arises through horses being hour after hour under the<lb/>
saddle with no relief from their burden.
</p>

<p>
Continuous pressure will kill anything. The weight of a drop of Con-<lb/>
water in course of time wears away a stone, and continuous pressure, tinuous<lb/>
quite irrespective and apart from bad saddle fitting, will wear holes in a ^^^f l"[f<lb/>
horse's back. The most perfectly fitting saddle that it is possible to anvthine.<lb/>
conceive will cause sore backs if worn for hours and days together with<lb/>
no reHef from pressure.
</p>

<p>
The value of this lesson will be again referred to in speaking of<lb/>
prevention, but the fact that long continued, unrelieved pressure will<lb/>
invariably cause sore backs cannot be too distinctly borne in mind.
</p>

<p>
It might be supposed that the weight of a horse's body was equally<lb/>
distributed over his limbs and that the hind and fore limbs supported the<lb/>
same weight.
</p>

<p>
This is not so. The fore limbs carry more of the body weight than Distribu-<lb/>
the hind, and the amount which they carry is influenced by the position ^'^^ ^<lb/>
of the head, which, if held high, relieves the forelegs from weight, and if Q^^l^g<lb/>
depressed increases the weight.
</p>

<p>
Nor is the rider's weight equally distributed over the limbs ; nearly<lb/>
two-thirds of it comes on the forelegs and only one-third on the hind.
</p>

<p>
The place on the back where a horse carries his saddle depends on<lb/>
his shape. With low thick withers the whole tendency of the animal's<lb/>

on, nothing but a special mechanical contrivance can prevent this taking<lb/>
place.
</p>

<p>
But no matter what the shape of the horse may be, the saddle has<lb/>
always a tendency to work forwards.
</p>

<p>
This may be explained by looking at any back, which shows that<lb/>
there is a small though distinct fall from the loins to the play of the<lb/>
shoulders ; besides this there is the weight of the rider, which must be an<lb/>
important element in determining whether the saddle will maintain its<lb/>
position or be carried forward.
</p>

<p>
Nothing, however, influences the question so much as the shape of<lb/>
the ribs ; if these are unduly curved and prominent, suddenly expanding<lb/>
behind the brisket, it is impossible for a girth to get a grip on the skin,<lb/>
and the saddle soon finds its way on to the root of the neck.
</p>

<p>
It might be thought that if the natural tendency of a saddle is to work<lb/>
forward, that the same must hold good for a numnah, saddle cloth, or<lb/>
blanket placed under the saddle. But the fact is otherwise ; these have a<lb/>
natural tendency to work backwards and come out at the rear of the<lb/>
saddle, and that, we think, is explained by the direction of the hair, the<lb/>
blanket or numnah slipping with the hair and not against it. Whatever<lb/>
the explanation may be, the facts remain that the tendency of a saddle<lb/>
is to work forward and of a numnah to work backwards, and<lb/>
one of the functions of a girth is to prevent this occurring.
</p>

<p>
The working forward of a saddle is a serious evil. We have previously<lb/>
referred to the blade-bones and their movements, but the time has now<lb/>
arrived when these must be studied with a little more detail, so that we<lb/>
may fully realise what are the disadvantages of blade-bone pressure.
</p>

<p>
At every movement of the forelegs the blade-bones are working to<lb/>
and fro ; when the foreleg and shoulder advances that portion of the<lb/>
blade-bone in front of the saddle goes backwards, on the principle of<lb/>
the see-saw movement previously alluded to, and conversely when the<lb/>
blade-bone in front of the saddle is travelling forward the foreleg is<lb/>
passing backwards.
</p>

<p>
Blade- bone movement is of the utmost importance; if a saddle be so<lb/>
fitted as to interfere with it the stride of the horse is shortened, he<lb/>
becomes tired before his time, and further, being unable to properly get<lb/>
the leg forward, he stumbles.
</p>

<p>
To ride on a horse's blade-bones throughout a long day's work is to<lb/>
ask him to perform his work at a mechanical disadvantage, and to<lb/>
imperil the safety of his knees, a fact which must be remembered in<lb/>
considering the correct position for the saddle.

</p>

<p>
The Saddle.
</p>

<p>
It is intended here to consider the saddle as a whole and not refer to<lb/>
any particular type, excepting where such reference is necessary. It is<lb/>
thought that in this way the subject can best be considered, as no matter<lb/>
how saddles may differ in detail, there is a certain unity of type existing,
</p>

<p>
The arches. â The framework of a saddle consists of two arches, one in The<lb/>
front and one behind the rider, each arch resting upon and secured to two arches,<lb/>
bars placed parallel to each other, through the medium of which the rider's<lb/>
weight is distributed on the back. This description holds good whether ^
</p>

<p>
we are speaking of the racing saddle of the twentieth century or the<lb/>
saddle hanging over the tomb of Henry V. in Westminster Abbey.
</p>

<p>
Two arches are used so as to ensure the spine is not pressed upon,<lb/>
and two bars are used by which the arches are kept in their place. Here<lb/>
we have the conception of a saddletree, the principles of which have<lb/>
never undergone a change ; finality was at once reached so far as the<lb/>
general idea of protection of the horse's back was concerned.
</p>

<p>
The more weight which is carried on the saddle, the stronger it has to<lb/>
be, and a stronger saddle is a heavier saddle. The question is often<lb/>
asked, Why is not a military saddle like a plain saddle and as light as<lb/>
one ? The answer is that such a pattern could not carry the impedi-<lb/>
menta, nor could a lightly constructed saddle possibly stand the strain to<lb/>
which a military saddle is exposed. It is obvious that the more weight<lb/>
it has to carry and support, the stronger it must be, and that the first step<lb/>
towards a light saddle is a light load.
</p>

<p>
The arches of a saddle are made of wood or metal, or a combination Materials<lb/>
of these. Metal is used in all military saddles constructed within the last of arches,<lb/>
twenty-five years ; prior to that two pieces of beech were given<lb/>
appropriate curves and secured together with an arch of steel known as a<lb/>
gullet plate.
</p>

<p>
Wooden arches strengthened by metal are used in all plain saddles and Wooden<lb/>
many others which for necessity might have to be impressed into arches,<lb/>
military service in time of war â for example, the so-called Colonial saddle.
</p>

<p>
The front arch forms the pommel, the rear arch the cantle ; Front<lb/>
both pommel and cantle may -be high or low ; they are made high, arch,<lb/>
especially the cantle, when bulky material has to be carried on the saddle.
</p>

<p>
The strain on a front is greater than that on a rear arch, for the reason strain on<lb/>
that, owing to the shape of the horse's body, the saddle is really resting on arches,<lb/>
a wedge (see fig. 27), and this with the weight of the rider is constantly<lb/>
exercising an outward strain on the arch. This strain is greatly increased<lb/>
where the fit is defective and excessive weight carried.

ment is often exposed. Iron arches, especially if flat and not angle iron,<lb/>
are very liable to open under ordinary strain, and this causes them to be<lb/>
condemned for military purposes. In a wooden arch it is the gullet plate<lb/>
which breaks, generally through a rivet hole.
</p>

<p>
It must be evident that in whatever way the front arch fractures, the<lb/>
risk of wither injury is considerable, but, as a matter of fact, the arch<lb/>
rarely breaks, and though wither injury is extremely common, it is only<lb/>
occasionally due to this cause.
</p>

Important The important points to attend to in an arch, apart from its strength,

points of are : â
</p>

<p>
1. Its height.
</p>

2. Its width.

due to one or the other of these causes. Either the arch is not high<lb/>
enough or it is too narrow ; sometimes there is a combination of these<lb/>
evils, but more frequently they are single and an injury from a narrow<lb/>
arch is more common than ihat from a low arch.
</p>

<p>
The subject of injuries has yet to be dealt with in detail, but to<lb/>
prevent misconception it is desirable to state here that most of them are<lb/>
the result of bad fitting, loss of condition or other service conditions rather<lb/>
than errors in manufacture, such as the above remarks might appear to<lb/>
suggest.<lb/>
"Points'" The front arch extends below the side bars , the extension is known<lb/>
of arch. as the " points," and these are intended to help the girths and prevent<lb/>
the saddle from heeling over. They appear unnecessary.

SADDLES AND SORE BACKS. 167
</p>

<p>
The rear arch is made of metal in all modern military saddles ; in Rear arch,<lb/>
plain saddles and those of the Colonial pattern it is of wood strengthened<lb/>
with steel.
</p>

<p>
The tendency for a front arch is to spread, but with a rear arch the Front arch<lb/>
tendency is to sink under the weight of the rider, and in consequence spreads,<lb/>
most military rear arches are supported by backstays to prevent this ''^^^ ^'"^^<lb/>
occurring. Like the front arch, it must be high enough to clear the<lb/>
spine, but the question of width is by no means so important as in the<lb/>
front arch, while the strength of material is equally important.
</p>

<p>
The side bars. â The side bars are that portion of the saddle which rests The<lb/>
on the back, and to which the ftont and rear arches are secured. side bars.
</p>

<p>
Side bars are generally made of wood, and are given a twist in the<lb/>
making which enables them to be adjusted to the curves of the back.
</p>

<p>
Side bars may be made of metal, but these are not in common use ; Materials<lb/>
wood, be it either for a military or plain saddle, is the substance generally for side<lb/>
employed. If figs. 27 and 28, which show the shape of the vertical t&amp;gt;ars.<lb/>
section of the body beneath the front and rear arches, be looked at, it will<lb/>
be obvious that the shape of bar suitable for one is unsuitable for the other,<lb/>
and speaking broadly we may say that while the side bar in front tends to<lb/>
be upright, behind it tends to be flat. This difference in shape is<lb/>
accomplished by giving the bar a twist in the process of manufacture.
</p>

<p>
We have dwelt on the fact that all horses do not have the same shape<lb/>
ot back, yet most side bars are so alike that one cannot be distinguished<lb/>
from another.
</p>

<p>
This fact has caused attempts to be made to manufacture self-adjusting Self-<lb/>
side bars, so as to enable them to take the curve of different shapes of adjusting<lb/>
back, and follow the alterations in shape which result from loss of flesh. ^^^^ h?ix^.
</p>

<p>
Such mechanical contrivances are not required in civil life for reasons<lb/>
which we cannot enter into here, but for military saddles would be of the<lb/>
highest value ; and their general adoption is only a matter of time.
</p>

<p>
The function of a side bar is to afford a firm support for the arches of Use of<lb/>
the saddle and to distribute the weight over the back. ^'^^ ^^'â â¢
</p>

<p>
Bearing in mind the weight-bearing region, viz., from the play of the<lb/>
shoulder to the last rib, it is clear that over this surface the side bars<lb/>
should rest evenly, squarely, and without undue pressure at anyone point.
</p>

<p>
Such is the theory ; the practice, however, is very different, arising from<lb/>
difficulties which are not always capable of control, especially the<lb/>
exigencies of military life.
</p>

<p>
Let us, however, assume a theoretically possible case, viz., the side<lb/>
bars of a saddle moulded and fitted to a horse's back in such a way that<lb/>
they bear evenly over the whole surface. This will take some patience

to accomplish, but it can be done by taking a mould of the back and<lb/>
working from it.
</p>

<p>
A saddle so fitted distributes the pressure evenly all over the surface<lb/>
of the side bars, but only so long as the back remains in the same<lb/>
condition as it was at the time of moulding. Should muscle waste occur<lb/>
the bars no longer fit ; should the muscles of the back become larger and<lb/>
fuller, the same result follows ; unless, therefore, the same condition is<lb/>
maintained, the care and time occupied in moulding the bars to the curves<lb/>
of the back is thrown away.
</p>

<p>
In practice we have to be satisfied with something which falls far<lb/>
short of the ideal, but is the nearest approach which is practicable.
</p>

<p>
This is just as marked in fitting a plain saddle, where, in fact, little or<lb/>
no attention is paid to the curves of the side bar, the fit of the saddle and<lb/>
distribution of weight being assured through the medium of a pannel<lb/>
stuffed with horse hair and flock.
</p>

<p>
If the side bars for military saddles were no longer than those used<lb/>
in plain saddles, their management would be greatly simplified, but it is<lb/>
considered necessary that they should project beyond the front arch and<lb/>
behind the rear arch, in order to assist in carrying the man's impedimenta.<lb/>
That part of the side bar projecting beyond the front arch is termed the<lb/>
" burr," and little reflection will show what a serious obstacle it may<lb/>
prove to the fitting of a saddle, and to the locomotion of the horse.
</p>

<p>
Taking the latter as being the most serious objection, it is evident<lb/>
from our account of the movements of the blade-bone, that a " burr " to<lb/>
the side bars is calculated, unless great care in fitting be adopted, to<lb/>
press upon the shoulder-blade and prevent the free extension of the limbs.<lb/>
If a horse cannot get his forelegs carried to the front w^ith freedom, he<lb/>
becomes tired earlier than he should. His shoulder-blades are encased<lb/>
in a veritable strait-jacket, if a pair of side bars are pressed into them<lb/>
by a tight girth and the weight of the rider.
</p>

<p>
It can be no matter for wonder that under these conditions he may<lb/>
even fall when tired, and under any circumstances may constantly<lb/>
stumble and trip.
</p>

<p>
No weight should be imposed on the blade bones ; free and un-<lb/>
controlled backward and forward movement is essential. The movement<lb/>
of the human ankle is a very fair comparison to the movements of the<lb/>
horse's blade-bones, and we can have no difficulty in realizing what the<lb/>
result of interfering with the free play of the ankle would be if we caused<lb/>
a wooden splint to project over it.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, in more than one case, the human foot and its management<lb/>
forms a very close parallel to the horse's back and saddle. There are

SADDLES AND SORE HACKS. 169
</p>

<p>
certain parts of the sole of the human foot incapable of bearing weight, the fit of<lb/>
and there are certain parts of the horse's back. The fit between the sole ^ ^Â°?^/"^<lb/>
of the boot and that of the foot should be perfect and ideally smooth. So ^ ^^ ^'<lb/>
should be the fit between the side bars of the saddle and the back. The<lb/>
least undue pressure on any part of the sole of the foot, caused by a<lb/>
wrinkle or even knot in the sock, will produce injury, and so will<lb/>
corresponding slight irregularities in the fit of a saddle produce a sore<lb/>
back. Any boot will not fit any foot, and any saddle will not fit any<lb/>
back. The comparison might be extended, but the point is secured if,<lb/>
instead of comparing the human foot and boot to the horse's foot and<lb/>
shoe (with which there is not a single point in common), we compare it<lb/>
to the horse's back and saddle, in which the parallel is remarkably close,<lb/>
while the comparison is valuable as an addition to one's common sense<lb/>
in applying practically the ideas here laid down.
</p>

<p>
The play of the shoulder-blade and the hollow behind the blade-<lb/>
bone are important landmarks in saddle fitting, and the side bar should<lb/>
lie in the latter and extend from there to the last rib. In spite of<lb/>
" burrs," a saddle may be so fitted as to occupy the position indicated<lb/>
without pressing on the blade-bones, and the question will be dealt with<lb/>
later.
</p>

<p>
The projecting portion of the side bars behind is known as the The ^<lb/>
"fan" ; it is given an upward sweep in the manufacture of the side bar, "'^"â¢<lb/>
but with many backs this is insufficient to carry it clear of the loins.
</p>

<p>
It is the loins and not the back proper which get injured by the fans,<lb/>
the injury being produced by friction. To understand this, we must<lb/>
glance at the movements of the loins during locomotion.
</p>

<p>
Attention has previously been drawn to the fact that the forelegs are<lb/>
not fastened to the body by means of any joint, and very little observation<lb/>
will show how close the blade-bones are to each other at this upper part ;<lb/>
in fact, if a hand be placed over the withers, the palm is in contact with<lb/>
one blade-bone, while the fingers are touching its fellow (fig. 26). Now,<lb/>
with the hind legs, a large joint secures each to the body, and these<lb/>
joints are several inches apart. In other words, while the forelegs above<lb/>
are set on close together, the hind legs are set on some distance apart.
</p>

<p>
The influence of this is to produce a rolling or side to side movement Rolling<lb/>
in the loins, with the advance of each hind leg. This movement can be movement<lb/>
better felt than seen, and is at once obvious if, when mounted, the hand Â° Â°"^^'<lb/>
is placed behind the saddle.
</p>

<p>
When the fans of the saddle rest on the loins, the friction produced by<lb/>
this rolling action produces injury, and the shorter the horse's back, the<lb/>
greater the chance of injury, as the fans then more completely cover the

</p>

<p>
loins. By care in fitting, it is comparatively simple to overcome this<lb/>
cause of trouble. (See fig. 35.)<lb/>
Certain There are certain classes of back which especially lend themselves
</p>

<p>
backs very to injury by both "burr" and " fan.^' For instance, a hollow back is<lb/>
liable to certain to be injured by both ends of the side bar and the reason of this<lb/>
\^l'^^ is evident.
</p>

<p>
" burr â ' ^ horse with thick low withers, with blade-bones comparatively wide
</p>

<p>
and "fan."" apart, is peculiarly liable to injury from the burr.
</p>

<p>
When muscle waste becomes established, the edge of the blade-bone<lb/>
at the play of the shoulder becomes more and more evident, as the long<lb/>
muscles of the back melt away, until it stands up like a new growth.
</p>

<p>
Under these conditions, the " burr " will press on it and do injury,<lb/>
as the muscles of the back having wasted, there is nothing to keep the<lb/>
saddle off the blade-bone.
</p>

<p>
Another type of back liable to injury from the side bar is the roach<lb/>
back, and it is evident that the position of the injury to which it is liable<lb/>
is just the reverse of that produced in a hollow back. In the roach back<lb/>
it is the centre of the side bar, rather than the extremities, which<lb/>
cause the trouble. On this point, further reference will be made in<lb/>
speaking of the cause of injuries.<lb/>
Distance The remaining point to notice about the framework of the saddle is
</p>

<p>
between the distance the two side bars are apart. In a plain saddle they are<lb/>
side bars, comparatively close together, and this has been followed in military<lb/>
saddles with disastrous results. We now know that the side bars must<lb/>
be kept sufficiently far apart to allow them to clear the side of the<lb/>
withers when the blanket, numnah or pannels are placed under the<lb/>
saddle. The distance which side bars are kept apart depends entirely<lb/>
upon the width of the front arch. Where the bars are close together the<lb/>
side of the wither gets pinched, especially when horses lose tiesh, so<lb/>
that it is almost impossible to have the channel between the bars<lb/>
too wide.
</p>

<p>
One great reason for this is that circumstances necessitate a blanket<lb/>
should be carried under the saddle â perhaps two ; and if the distance<lb/>
between side bars is insufficient, the thickness of these blankets will<lb/>
cause the side bar to rest on the side of the withers, for it is obvious<lb/>
that the tendency of a saddle blanket and numnah is to fill up the<lb/>
interval between the side bars.<lb/>
The seat T^e seat atid flaps.â ^^ have so far considered the framework ot
</p>

<p>
and flaps, the saddle, viz., the two arches and side bars. These comprise the<lb/>
essentials of a saddle, and if they fit â or to put it perhaps more<lb/>
accurately â if these are big enough, and in any way resemble the surface

SADDLES AND SORK BACKS. I?'
</p>

<p>
on which they are to rest, the other parts of the saddle become mere ,
</p>

<p>
accessories, for example, the seat, flaps, pannels, etc.
</p>

<p>
The seat is a convenience for the rider ; a blanket laid over the tree<lb/>
of the saddle would do as well, provided there was very little back waste.<lb/>
The seat is a part of the saddle which, so far as it relates to the<lb/>
man, does not here concern us, but it may be a source of mjury to the<lb/>
horse, if through the leather work stretching or stitches giving<lb/>
way, it comes down on to the spine ; it is obvious that this is<lb/>
only likely to occur through loss of condition or its equivalent, so<lb/>
far as saddle fitting is concerned, viz., thin blanket or pannels. The<lb/>
strain on a seat is considerable, and in order to support this<lb/>
bridge of leather, there is introduced under it a sling of webbing<lb/>
which runs from arch to arch, and so takes off very largely the strain<lb/>
on the leather.
</p>

<p>
Seats are strained by other methods than riding : a tight over-girth is<lb/>
one of the chief causes of seats sinking.
</p>

<p>
Flaps to the saddle, like seats, are not a necessity, but a convenience â<lb/>
a blanket would do as well. The saddle flap is rarely the cause of<lb/>
injury, and we may therefore dismi-s any further consideration of it.
</p>

<p>
The material which goes between the saddle and the back consists of ^^^<lb/>
blanket and numnah, or numnah and pannels or numnah, blanket and ^'^^^^jg^"<lb/>
pannels. The ordinary service method consists of a numnah and blanket '^^^ i^^^,],^<lb/>
on which the bare side bars rest, or the latter may be further protected<lb/>
by pannels made of numnah.
</p>

<p>
These three structures must be separately.
</p>

<p>
Pa7inels. â Those on a plain saddle consist of a bag made of leather Pannels.<lb/>
and serge, stufled w^ith flock and horsehair, but in military saddles they<lb/>
have been long discarded. In face of the fact, however, that all types of<lb/>
saddle are used in war, including those with hair pannels, it is necessary<lb/>
the subject should receive some consideration at our hands.
</p>

<p>
Pannels stufted with hair have one very great advantage, viz., that Stuffed<lb/>
in course of time they get moulded to the shape of the horse's back, and pannels.<lb/>
adjust themselves to all irregularities. This is the explanation why<lb/>
so little attention is paid to the fit of a plain saddle ; so long as the<lb/>
front arch is wide enough, the saddler does not trouble his head<lb/>
any further, but depends upon the hair in the pannels completing<lb/>
the fit, which it most certainly does. This adjustment of pannels to<lb/>
the shape of the back is very noticeable ; the stufiing in a new pair<lb/>
of pannels will with very little work settle down, so that the pahnel<lb/>
becomes reduced in thickness ; and while the settling down is taking<lb/>
place the two bags of hair are being moulded to the peculiarities of

</p>

<p>
Theoretically this is wrong in principle, though it certainly works out<lb/>
in practice, and may, therefore, be defended ; but for the pannel, the<lb/>
civil saddle would be a constant cause of sore back.
</p>

<p>
Pannels have their weak points, they may be too bulky or too thin,<lb/>
the stuffing may have become hard, lumpy, or even caked if sweat has<lb/>
passed in. Until every soldier knows something of saddlery, it is fair<lb/>
to urge that a pannel requires a saddler to deal with it, whereas there are<lb/>
other means much simpler, such as a blanket, which a soldier may adjust<lb/>
for himself. No doubt it is owing to this that pannels have disappeared<lb/>
from the regular service of the Army, as their alterations can only be<lb/>
effected by a trained man.
</p>

<p>
Pannels have been made of felt (numnah) and fitted to the side bars ;<lb/>
by themselves they are insufficient protection to the back. They must<lb/>
be used with a blanket, and are then useful. Strips of numnah of<lb/>
varying lengths may be usefully employed in making a saddle fit ; two,<lb/>
three, or more layers may be cut out, kept together by a stitch or two,<lb/>
and bound to the side bar. This will be again referred to in dealing<lb/>
with sore backs, for which purpose strips of numnah are of the greatest<lb/>
value.
</p>

<p>
Blankets.â h blanket beneath the saddle is a most admirable method<lb/>
of protection. It does not lend itself like a pannel to graduated variations<lb/>
in thickness, but on the other hand, it can be dealt with by a person<lb/>
without any instruction in the trade of a saddler, and the changes he<lb/>
can effect by altering the method of folding may be brought about in a<lb/>
few minutes.
</p>

<p>
A good thick blanket is economy, a thin blanket an abomination ; a<lb/>
good blanket folds, a thin blanket wrinkles ; a good blanket saves a back<lb/>
from bruising, and lasts some time ; a thin blanket has a short life,<lb/>
and is never satisfactory when horses are losing condition.
</p>

<p>
The great recommendation of a blanket is that so many useful<lb/>
adjustments may be made by alterations in its folding when a back<lb/>
becomes worn or injured, and this will even be the chief recommendation<lb/>
of a blanket under a military saddle. In fact, a blanket is the only means<lb/>
of immediately replacing artificially the amount of flesh a horse loses, and<lb/>
so enables us not only to prevent the ribs from becoming bruised through<lb/>
the whole weight of the rider being brought closer to the body, but also<lb/>
to keep the arches of the saddle clear of the spine. We must not forget<lb/>
that every ounce of flesh lost on the back brings the saddle nearer to the<lb/>
delicate parts below, and increases enormously the liability to injury.

SADDLES AND SORE BACKS. I73
</p>

<p>
Is the saddle blanket to be used as a horse blanket ? We are aware<lb/>
that this question has been authoritatively settled in favour of the one<lb/>
blanket performing both services ; but it appears to be opposed to all<lb/>
experience.
</p>

<p>
No ordinary human skill or foresight can prevent some blankets<lb/>
working off in the night, getting under the horse's feet, and becoming<lb/>
torn, muddy, and wet. All these are inseparable from the use of any<lb/>
cover for a horse's body, and especially one which has to be kept on without<lb/>
a proper body roller, and often without a pad. It frequently happens<lb/>
that, having found from experience the most suitable method of<lb/>
folding a blanket, a stitch or two is placed in it to keep the folds<lb/>
in position ; this may be a most useful expedient, but is of no use if the<lb/>
blanket is also to be used as a horse cover. There can be no doubt<lb/>
that in practice the saddle blanket will not, for the reasons stated<lb/>
above, be used for two distinct and antagonistic purposes, but that<lb/>
reason and experience dictate a saddle blanket shall remain a saddle<lb/>
blanket.
</p>

<p>
If a blanket be placed under a saddle, especially one with bare side Fixing of<lb/>
bars, it gradually works out behind ; to prevent this the blanket does not blanket by<lb/>
rest directly on the back but on a numnah, which gives it a grip ; the i^ur"nah<lb/>
numnah is buckled in front and rear to both arches of the saddle, and in ^^^^P"^-<lb/>
this way the blanket is confined.
</p>

<p>
The saddle blanket is not a square : the length is five feet five inches. Folding<lb/>
the width four feet eight inches, and the method of folding usually adopted the<lb/>
in the Service is to make three folds of equal width in the length of the blanket,<lb/>
blanket, turning over two feet of one end and passing the opposite end<lb/>
into the pocket thus formed ; it is then placed on the horse's back with<lb/>
the thick end near the withers. The size when folded is two feet by one<lb/>
foot eight inches.
</p>

<p>
There are several methods of dealing with the blanket, which will be<lb/>
referred to in the section on sore backs, but the general principles may<lb/>
be conyeniently noticed here.
</p>

<p>
1. The distance from front to rear numnah strap is twenty inches.
</p>

<p>
It is obvious that the folds of the blanket shall be made of<lb/>
such a width as to conveniently fit into this space without<lb/>
wrinkling.
</p>

<p>
2. The more folds placed in a blanket the more the channel between
</p>

<p>
the two side bars of the saddle is filled up. In consequence ot<lb/>
this, pressure is exercised upon the spine and withers, which may<lb/>
get pinched and inflamed. If it is necessary to place many folds<lb/>
in the blanket, they should be put under the side bar and
</p>

</p>

<p>
not under the arches, the blanket being folded from each side and<lb/>
not from the centre. In this way the channel of the saddle is<lb/>
not filled up ; by any other system it is.
</p>

<p>
When speaking of the front arch, we impressed the necessity of it<lb/>
being wide enough to admit the blanket, numnah and whatever else may<lb/>
be placed under the saddle.
</p>

<p>
No more folds should be placed in a saddle blanket than are necessary.
</p>

<p>
What thickness of material shall be placed beneath the saddle ? This<lb/>
is governed by two conditions, (a) the amount of flesh on the back, (d) the<lb/>
amount of work a horse is performing. Assuming that the conditions<lb/>
are service conditions, viz. : a moderate amount of flesh on the back and<lb/>
an immoderate amount of work to be performed, then the golden<lb/>
rule is to have ample material beneath the saddle in order to<lb/>
prevent the parts becoming bruised through heavy weight and long<lb/>
hours. Weight transmitted through a thick blanket and good numnah<lb/>
is distributed ; that which is transmitted through a thin protection is<lb/>
concentrated.
</p>

<p>
It is well to draw attention once more to the fact that the blanket<lb/>
must lie level and unwrinkled between the two straps of the numnah ;<lb/>
further, as these straps are twenty inches apart, the distance from front to<lb/>
rear of any folded blanket must fall within this limit.
</p>

<p>
There can never be less than three layers of blanket beneath the<lb/>
arch, as a blanket has to be folded twice to make it fit into the above<lb/>
space. Three layers of blanket beneath the arch is, then, the minimum,<lb/>
while six layers beneath the side bars would also be a minimum. The<lb/>
latter would be obtained by laying a blanket folded in three layers across<lb/>
the back, and then turning up one extremity and placing it under the<lb/>
side bar, but not carried up so high as to fill in the arch. No matter in<lb/>
what way a blanket is folded, this is the fewest number of layers which<lb/>
can be put in it.
</p>

<p>
It is most desirable there should be as few layers of blanket beneath<lb/>
the arches as possible ; the necessity for this has previously been dealt<lb/>
with.
</p>

<p>
A blanket may be folded six layers throughout, by folding first in<lb/>
three and then doubling it. Three layers under the ai ches and six<lb/>
under the side bar has been described ; three under the arches and nine<lb/>
under the side bar is obtained by folding up both ends twice.
</p>

<p>
In putting nine layers under the side bar, it must not be forgotten<lb/>
that the ribs are left very exposed, and that there is nothing but the<lb/>
numnah to prevent the ribs from being bruised by the girth attachment<lb/>
and girth buckles.
</p>

			<p>
SADDLES AND SORE BACKS. 175
</p>

<p>
Nine layers of blanket under the side bar can only be required for<lb/>
horses losing muscle, and where the back waste is great, there may<lb/>
not be sufficient to keep the saddle at its proper height above the spine.<lb/>
In such cases twelve layers may be employed, but it is better to<lb/>
use hay, grass, straw, rushes, and such like, placed between the<lb/>
folds of the blanket under the side bar, rather than twelve layers of<lb/>
blanket.
</p>

<p>
The disadvantage of having too many folds under the side bar, apart<lb/>
from the risk of the ribs being bruised, is the difficulty of keeping them<lb/>
in position, unless the blanket is stitched at one or two points.
</p>

<p>
One man can fold a blanket, but it is better done by two ; the folds<lb/>
are then made with greater regularity, and there is less chance of a<lb/>
blanket being placed on the back with wrinkles in it.
</p>

<p>
Numnahs are generally made of felt, though leather has been tried. Numnahs.<lb/>
The use of a numnah is not to make the saddle fit or render it soft to the<lb/>
back (incidentally it does both), but its function is to absorb the sweat<lb/>
and prevent it passing into the blanket or pannels. This is where the<lb/>
leather numnah failed ; it was not absorbent, and in addition presented<lb/>
the disadvantage of becoming dry and hard under the influence of<lb/>
sweat.
</p>

<p>
The Girth. â Various considerations cause the service girth to be made The girth,<lb/>
of leather, rather than webbing, cord, or raw hide. The last three, however,<lb/>
may have to be used and are excellent as long as they last.
</p>

<p>
A soldier's saddle has to be kept more firmly girthed up than a<lb/>
civilian's, owing to the greater weight, much of it top-heavy. To avoid<lb/>
undue oscillation this weight has to be steadied, and a girth too tight for<lb/>
a hunter may be absolutely necessary with a troop horse.
</p>

<p>
In order to give further assistance in steadying the weight, the girth,<lb/>
instead of being secured to a central attachment, is buckled into straps<lb/>
which come from either end of the saddle. This V attachment is an<lb/>
immense advantage where great weight is concerned.
</p>

<p>
The girth passes around the brisket, and owing to the shape of the Conforma-<lb/>
latter, it lies in a kind of hollow formed by the brisket and belly. Some tion v;ith<lb/>
briskets are so shaped that no hollow place exists for the girth, and with reference<lb/>
such horses the girth works forward against the elbow owing to the ^Â°^, â¢<lb/>
brisket running up instead of down. Under ordinary circumstances it is ^' '^^'<lb/>
the edge of the girth pressing against the brisket which keeps the saddle<lb/>
back ; if the girth gets no such purchase against the brisket the saddle<lb/>
goes forward.
</p>

<p>
A brisket which runs up towards the elbow instead of down,<lb/>
is frequently associated with a prominent arching of the rear ribs and a

big spreading belly. This is a hopeless combination with an ordinary<lb/>
girth, and means that the horse must always carry his saddle on his<lb/>

</p>

<p>
A string, raw hide, and webbing girth act by the facility with which<lb/>
they catch not only the edge of the brisket but the skin ; with a hide or<lb/>
string girth portions of skin project between the strands, which have a<lb/>
steadying effect, but especially there is the grip which a narrow<lb/>
material like string has over wide material like webbing.
</p>

<p>
This action is frequently imitated in leather girths by splitting them<lb/>
into laces, and a split leather girth is regulation.
</p>

<p>
One of the great difficulties with a girth is to prevent it getting harsh<lb/>
through sweat and dirt, and this particularly applies to a leather or hide<lb/>
girth, yet under ordinary circumstances it is not the harshness of a<lb/>
girth which causes it to gall, but rather the bodily shifting forward of the<lb/>
saddle, by which the edge of the girth is dragged forward behind the<lb/>
elbow.
</p>

<p>
Girth galling is either a question of condition or of make and shape.<lb/>
A horse that persistently galls is one with wide arching ribs, elbows<lb/>
close to the sides, big belly and shallow brisket.
</p>

<p>
The prevention and palliation of girth galls will be considered later.

<p>
Fitting the Saddle.
</p>

<p>
It has not been found possible in speaking of the structure of the<lb/>
saddle to avoid making some reference to its fit, but this section is<lb/>
specially devoted to a consideration of the fundamental principles of<lb/>
saddle fitting.
</p>

<p>
There are six axioms in saddle fitting never to be forgotten. They<lb/>
constitute the essence of the whole subject, and when they are applied<lb/>
intelligently, saddle fitting becomes almost an exact science :
</p>

<p>
1st. The withers must not be pinched nor j2^n\wÂ£'&amp;lt;'/ upon.
</p>

<p>
2nd. The central line of the back must have no pressure imposed
</p>

<p>
upon it.<lb/>
3rd. The blade-bones must have free and uncontrolled movement.<lb/>
4th. The loins are not intended to carry weight.<lb/>
5th, The weight must be imposed upon the ribs through the medium
</p>

<p>
of the muscles covering them.<lb/>
6th. The weight must be evenly distributed over a surface which
</p>

<p>
extends from the play of the shoulders to the last rib.

SADDLES AND SORE BACKS. 177
</p>

<p>
In rule ist the word " pressed " is placed in italics ; there are many<lb/>
who know the withers must not be pinched, but there are many who do<lb/>
not realise that something far short of pinching is sufficient to set up<lb/>
disease if long continued.
</p>

<p>
In fitting a saddle, that size which is nearest to the horse's require- Method<lb/>
ments is selected. There are several sizes to choose from, and in making of fitting,<lb/>
the choice the bare tree is tried on the back. J^"*- Â°" ^"^
</p>

<p>
Having been placed on the back, the front arch resting in the pit ot '^^^ '^^^'<lb/>
the shoulder, the following points are looked to :
</p>

<p>
The arch and seat should, if possible, be clear of the spine. This is not<lb/>
always possible with horses possessing high withers, but it is desirable<lb/>
in order to ascertain the fit of the side bars.
</p>

<p>
The front arch must be wide enough to admit the hand on either side<lb/>
of the wither.
</p>

<p>
The side bars must bear evenly on the back, or as nearly so as can be<lb/>
obtained. The points of the tree must be wide enough apart to clear the<lb/>
ribs.
</p>

<p>
The side bars must not be too long. At this stage it is no use looking to<lb/>
blade-bone and loin pressure ; these can only hope to be avoided when<lb/>
the blanket and numnah are placed under the saddle. All we can do at<lb/>
this stage is to make sure the edge of the side bar is not pressing into<lb/>
the withers or ribs, and that the arches are wide enough.
</p>

<p>
A numnah is now placed on the back, and the tree on the numnah,<lb/>
but without a blanket. This manoeuvre considerably raises the saddletree.<lb/>
The amount by which it is raised gives an index to the required thickness<lb/>
of the blanket.
</p>

<p>
It cannot be too often insisted on that a numnah or a blanket reduces<lb/>
the width of a front arch, and narrows the saddle across the top of the<lb/>
side bars.
</p>

<p>
The blanket is now folded, placed on the numnah and the tree on the Add<lb/>
blanket. The blanket and numnah are pressed up well into the front numnah<lb/>
arch, and before girthing up it should be noticed whether the " burrs " are ^5!||^j,^j<lb/>
off the shoulders and the fans off the loins ; if they are not the thick-<lb/>
ness of the blanket beneath the side bars must be increased by turning it<lb/>
up on either side. The girths are now pulled up and a man placed in Girth up.<lb/>
the saddle.
</p>

<p>
The fit of a saddle can never be determined without seeing a man in<lb/>
it ; parts may appear out of harm's way when no weight is in the saddle,<lb/>
which are brought dangerously close under the pressure of a man's weight.
</p>

<p>
The first thing to ascertain is the freedom from wither pressure ; the Test for<lb/>
hand must readily find admission beneath the numnah over the top and wither<lb/>
(B 10948) M pressure.

<p>
man should lean forward, and the examiner must not be satisfied with
</p>

<p>
anything less than the introduction of the entire hand.
</p>

<p>

<p>
blade-bone is done by passing the hand beneath the numnah to the play of the

either a pair of numnah pannels on the side bar or an extra fold of
</p>

<p>
blanket. Both blade-bones are, of course, tested.

SADDLES AND SORE HACKS. 179
</p>

<p>
Should the saddle under examination be in possession of hair pannels,<lb/>
and these found to be pressing on the shoulder-blades or loins, the hair<lb/>
must be forced backwards out of the part by means of an awl, and the<lb/>
part of the pannel corresponding to the " burr '"' or " fans " stitched across<lb/>
to keep the hair trom re-entering. (Fig. 35.)
</p>

<p>
Assuming we have remedied all the above defects, the saddle should be<lb/>
ridden in, say, for half an hour, and the next step is to ascertain whether<lb/>
the pressure of the side bars is evenly distributed ; this can be learned in<lb/>
the following way.
</p>

<p>
The saddle is carefully ungirthed, the nummah straps unbuckled, and Ungirth<lb/>
the tree lifted from the blanket without in the least disturbing it. The
</p>

<p>

. View of pannel with the stuffing arranged to keep pressure oft<lb/>
the blade-bones and loins.
</p>

<p>
blanket will be found to bear the imprint of the side bars, and an and note<lb/>
examination of this depression shows at a glance whether they are ^'?\P''I^^ ^^<lb/>
pressing evenly from top to bottom and from front to rear. '^"^ ^^^^'
</p>

<p>
The examination has to be rapidly made, as the blanket through its<lb/>
elasticity soon loses the impression of the side bars and the mark of the<lb/>
latter becomes obliterated.
</p>

<p>
The most usual places to find excessive pressure are at the top edge<lb/>
of the side bar behind the front arch, and the bottom edge in front of<lb/>
the rear arch, and if there is a deeper impression on the blanket in<lb/>
these situations than any other portion of the bar, we may accordingly<lb/>
say with certainty that the pressure is not evenly distributed and that<lb/>
the parts of the back corresponding with the more marked impressions<lb/>
are receiving an undue amount of the weight. This with a horse in<lb/>

<p>
condition, or with a good blanket and nummab, may not necessarily<lb/>
mean a sore back ; but it certainly means a sore back should the horse<lb/>
lose condition or the blanket or pannel be thin and the tree be thus<lb/>
brought nearer to the bony framework.
</p>

<p>
This irregularity in the fit of the side bars may be remedied by<lb/>
the introduction of pieces of nummah to fill up the space between the<lb/>
side bars and blanket. With very little practice these pieces of felt may<lb/>
be cut to the required shape and thickness ; some edges will need to be<lb/>
almost as thin as a knife-blade, and other parts will require adding to.
</p>

<p>
Once the pieces of felt have been cut they must be secured in<lb/>
position. In peace this can be at once done with glue, but in the<lb/>
field they may have to be tied on, or tacks put through them, or, what is<lb/>
best, bound in position by means of a piece of thin leather (basil) which<lb/>
envelops the side bar at the required part and can be tacked to its edge<lb/>
or laced with string across the top.
</p>

<p>
These strips of felt are capable of effecting the most radical<lb/>
alterations in the fit of a side bar : the method has the value of<lb/>
simplicity and requires no trained workman to carry out ; finally it can be<lb/>
carried out in a very few minutes.
</p>

<p>
It must never be forgotten that no matter what care we take in the<lb/>
fitting and alteration of saddles, such fitting is only applicable to the<lb/>
" condition " the horse is in at the time. On active service the saddles<lb/>
require looking to every day. They should be inspected just as regularly as<lb/>
the feet are. Every weak point in the fit of a saddle in a squadron should<lb/>
be known, and the remedy already arranged for should trouble arise. In<lb/>
no other way is it possible to bring horses through severe work with<lb/>
whole backs.
</p>

<p>
No allusion has been made to any other form of side bar but the<lb/>
rigid one of beech, and but a limited reference to pannels ; both these<lb/>
points may be touched on briefly, as they represent the direction<lb/>
in which progress will in future be made, and in which advances are<lb/>
most urgently needed.
</p>

<p>
Adjustable side bars, owing to the arrangement of their mechanism,<lb/>
are capable of taking the curves of the back automatically. They are<lb/>
perhaps at present too delicate for the rough usage everything receives<lb/>
at the hands of a soldier, but are referred to as an example of what is<lb/>
required, and what must in course of time come to be adopted. They<lb/>
possess the immense advantage of automatically regulating their parellelism<lb/>
to the back, and so the weight carried is always equally distributed.
</p>

<p>
It must have occurred to many reading this section that pneumatic<lb/>
pannels would solve the problem of what to place under the saddle, as they
</p>

<p>
would effect an enormous saving in concussion to which the spine is at<lb/>
present exposed, and largely reduce weight. Such pannels have been<lb/>
made and used, but there is a natural timidity to trust a horse's back to the<lb/>
security of a rubber patch, though the provision of an air cushion is an ideal<lb/>
conception for a pannel.
</p>

<p>
Granulated cork has been tried for filling pannels, but anything of a Cork<lb/>
granular nature has a tendency to work in one direction instead of pannels.<lb/>
keeping its position, though this can to an extent be provided against.
</p>

<p>
Sore Backs : How they are Caused, Prevented, and<lb/>
Remedied.
</p>

<p>
Under the term " sore backs " is included all injuries inflicted on horses<lb/>
by the saddle, whether such injury affects the back proper or the withers ;<lb/>
we must, however, for the purpose of description, draw a clear line<lb/>
between these, as the causes operating in producing injuries to the<lb/>
withers are not causes which injure the back, and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
The first thing to learn is that the position of a sore back is not an A sore<lb/>
accidental circumstance, but is the outcome of a definite cause. If we back has<lb/>
appreciate the value of this axiom, and know the causes operating in ^ definite<lb/>
producing the various injuries, we are able to recognise almost by ^^"^^â¢<lb/>
glancing at a sore back the actual cause operating in its production
</p>

<p>
(fig- 36).
</p>

<p>
Ihe knowledge that in nearly every case of injury, the cause can be<lb/>
clearly determined, is valuable information, for if we remove the cause.,<lb/>
the effect ceases. If we know the cause of a sore back and can remove it,<lb/>
that sore back will not recur, and, moreover, in the majority of cases,<lb/>
the cause being removed, the horse may perhaps be able to continue at<lb/>
its duty (under conditions which it is the object of this section to impart),<lb/>
and thus hardly lose a day in the ranks.
</p>

<p>
Every sore, every injury, every abrasion on a horse's back is due<lb/>
to a certain definite cause, which if removed produces no fiirther effect.<lb/>
Let this be taught to non-commissioned ofiicers and men, and encourage<lb/>
all ranks to bring at once to notice every rub, no matter how slight.
</p>

<p>
This must be instilled into the mind of everyone that has to do with a<lb/>
horse. The old system of punishing a man whose horse had a sore back<lb/>
led to concealment of trouble, and, moreover, in at least ninety per cent,<lb/>
of the cases was unjust.
</p>

<p>
Faults i?i saddling. â At this point it may be desirable to consider the Faults in<lb/>
question of a man's ability to give a horse a sore back. Prejudice dies saddling,<lb/>
very hard, and there are probably still many people who speak of a man

<p>
giving his horse a sore back, when the fault lies with the saddle or the<lb/>
condition of the horse.
</p>

<p>
The previous position has been something as follows : â A horse gets<lb/>
a sore back or a girth-gall ; the man is told the fault lies with him, either<lb/>
bad saddling, or rolling in his saddle, and as a punishment he has to<lb/>
walk. It is quite right that he should walk, but as a necessity, and not<lb/>
as a punishment. The fault very rarely lies with the man.<lb/>
Bad The term "bad saddling" is also used far too loosely, and it is well
</p>

<p>
saddlinj^. ^^^^it some definition of it should be given, always bearing in mind that<lb/>
there is a marked distinction between bad saddling and defective fitting ;<lb/>
the soldier is responsible for the former, the officer for the latter.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example which may help to define responsibility. A horse<lb/>
meets with an injury to the withers, due to the arch of the saddle resting<lb/>
on the spine ; this is defective fitting, for which the officer is responsible.<lb/>
A horse meets with an injury to the withers, due to the numnah resting<lb/>
on the spine, and not being pressed up into the front arch and fixed there<lb/>
by the strap. Such an injury is bad saddling, for which the rider is<lb/>
responsible.
</p>

<p>
It may be convenient to classify bad saddling : â
</p>

<p>
1. The numnah not strapped up in front and rear.
</p>

<p>
2. The loose end of any strap getting in between the numnah and
</p>

<p>
skin.
</p>

<p>
3. Any portion of the rear pack resting on the spine, or even only
</p>

<p>
touching it.
</p>

<p>
4. The sweat flap of the girth â or in pannelled saddles, the pannel
</p>

<p>
flap â getting turned in when putting the saddle on in a hurry,<lb/>
thus forming a thick ridge which gets pressed into the side and<lb/>
produces injury.
</p>

<p>
5. A horse is badly saddled which has either a loose girth or a tight
</p>

<p>
surcingle. Apart from actual vice, the above comprises all the<lb/>
bad saddling which is possible.
</p>

<p>
Rolling in Men are spoken of as rolling in the saddles, and this rolling is
</p>

<p>
the saddle, regarded as a cause of sore back. By rolling is understood, not the<lb/>
behaviour of a drunken man in the saddle, but twisting, turning,<lb/>
" lolling " and general uneasiness of the rider, which twists the saddle on<lb/>
the horse's back. It is seldom the actual cause of a sore back, but it<lb/>
gives the horse considerable inconvenience, and increases the load he<lb/>
has to carry, for the twisting causes a displacement of the balance of<lb/>
weight to occur, resulting in more weight being carried on one side than<lb/>
the other.
</p>

SADDLES AND SORE HACKS. 1 83
</p>

<p>
This wearing out of a tired horse by a tired man is effectually met by Advantage<lb/>
at once dismounting the man, and letting him lead his horse. After he Â°f occa-<lb/>
has done some distance, his tired riding muscles will have regained their ^^Â°"^jj<lb/>
tone, and he can then remount. when
</p>

<p>
. In long marches, men get tired or cramped through being hours in tired,<lb/>
one position, they twist and turn in the saddle, lean forward, or quit their<lb/>
stirrups and let their bodies sway about. The wholesome corrective for<lb/>
this is dismounting the men. In a long march every man should walk and<lb/>
lead his horse for a portion of every hour, which prevents " rolling,"<lb/>
and secures the important advantage of allowing the blood to circulate<lb/>
freely through the skin.
</p>

<p>
Irregularities occurring on the line of march should be detected by the<lb/>
officer. If men injure and wear out their horses by rolling about in the<lb/>
saddle, he is to blame, for he should have at once detected it, and<lb/>
applied the remedy.
</p>

<p>
These things can never be seen unless looked for, and if all the officers<lb/>
' of a squadron ride at the head of it, their backs are turned towards<lb/>
what is occurring. Where horses are concerned nothing can take the<lb/>
place of the eye of the master. The troop officer should ride in no fixed<lb/>
position on the march : first on one side of the column, then on the other,<lb/>
now halting and letting his horses pass him, now riding behind and<lb/>
looking at them from the rear. Such supervision repays itself a hundred-<lb/>
fold, while the moral effect cannot be over-estimated,
</p>

<p>
General causes of injuries. â Every injury to back, shoulders or other General<lb/>
part of the body due to saddles, harness or collars, is brought about by causes ot<lb/>
one of two means, or a combination of the two, viz. â injuries.
</p>

<p>
1. By friction.
</p>

<p>
2. By pressure.
</p>

<p>
No matter whether the injury consists of a few hairs rubbed off, or a<lb/>
swelling on the withers the size of a child's head, the cause is as above.
</p>

<p>
From what has been said in dealing with the structure of the back, no<lb/>
difficulty will be experienced in understanding how friction or pressure<lb/>
acts : the one wears away the part by rubbing, the other by partly or<lb/>
entirely cutting off the blood supply.
</p>

<p>
We have shown that no living tissue can stand continuous pressure,<lb/>
not even when a relatively soft and light body is inflicting it, let alone a<lb/>
mechanism of steel and wood like a saddletree.
</p>

<p>
That a certain power of resistance to both friction and pressure exists<lb/>
is undoubted ; a horse in hard condition can stand much more of either<lb/>
than one in soft condition.

<p>
Bearing of<lb/>
condition<lb/>
on<lb/>
injuries.
</p>

<p>
Wither<lb/>
injuries.
</p>

<p>
The evil of soft condition is more readily shown by friction than by<lb/>
pressure. It is remarkable how little friction the soft horse can tolerate.
</p>

<p>
The tolerance of both friction and pressure is characteristic of the<lb/>
horse in hard condition, and we see the same in the well-trained man,<lb/>
who is very difficult to bruise.
</p>

<p>
Condition enormously influences the production of sore backs, and<lb/>
condition may be of three kinds :
</p>

<p>
1. Hard condition, such as we meet with in the full-fed, hard-
</p>

<p>
worked horse.
</p>

<p>
2. Poor condition such as is met with in the horse under-fed and
</p>

<p>
over-worked.
</p>

<p>
3. Soft condition, well seen in the fat horse who has done no
</p>

<p>
work.
</p>

<p>
No. I takes a lot of friction and much pressure, but Nos. 2 and 3,<lb/>
though at opposite poles, behave as if identical. In No. 2 the vitality and<lb/>
resisting power are lowered through hard work and insufficient food ; in<lb/>
No. 3 there is a good deal of vitality, but of a fluid kind, it soon evaporates,<lb/>
while of resisting power there is none.
</p>

<p>
In every function of a horse's life the question of condition presents<lb/>
itself. It influences lameness and sore backs, it is the basis of staying<lb/>
power and resistance to disease.
</p>

<p>
It may be said that there is no part of a saddle which is not capable<lb/>
of producing an injury, though it is certain that some parts produce it<lb/>
more frequently than others.
</p>

<p>
Wither injuries. â The withers are the most frequent seat of injury at<lb/>
the present day, and there are several causes in operation to account for<lb/>
this.
</p>

<p>
An injury to the withers may be on the top or on the sides ; the class<lb/>
of wither most commonly affected is the high lean one or the short thick
</p>

<p>
Wither injuries are caused by the following : â
</p>

<p>
1. The numnah resting on the spine either through the strap not being
</p>

<p>
buckled or through it having broken.
</p>

<p>
2. The front arch of the saddle being narrowed and filled up by too
</p>

<p>
many folds of the blanket, aggravated, perhaps, by a saddle too<lb/>
narrow in the arch. This is especially evident in a horse with<lb/>
thick withers.
</p>

<p>
3. Loss of "back muscle," by which the entire saddle is brought
</p>

<p>
nearer to the bony framework. This is especially evident in a<lb/>
horse with high withers.
</p>

<p/>

			<p>
SADDLES AND SORE BACKS. 1 85
</p>

<p>
All the above are aggravated by the weight carried ; the heavier the<lb/>
man â perhaps we should say the heavier the load â the greater the damage<lb/>
inflicted. The more unequal the balance of weight carried the greater<lb/>
the risk of injury ; where the balance of weight is disturbed, the saddle<lb/>
heels over towards the heaviest side ; but for the withers it might com-<lb/>
pletely heel over, as the withers act as a break and in consequence suffer.
</p>

<p>
For this reason, if for no other, men should be made to sit in<lb/>
a firm and erect manner in their saddle. Every turn or twist of the<lb/>
body causes the saddle to heel over, and if either 2 or 3 in the above<lb/>
table are in operation it aggravates matters.
</p>

<p>
And so with the balance of the kit carried ; if more is being carried on<lb/>
the near than the off side the saddle naturally heels, and if there is a<lb/>
tendency to 2 or 3 it is increased. This matter of the lialance of weight<lb/>
is so important that it will be referred to again.
</p>

<p>
What are the remedies for the above sore backs ? Remedies
</p>

<p>
No. I is obvious ; the numnah merely requires to be well strapped up for wither<lb/>
in the arch. injuries.
</p>

<p>
No. 2 : Here we must reduce the number of folds in the blanket under<lb/>
the arch and increase them under the side bar. This can be readily done<lb/>
by folding the blanket in three in the usual way, laying it over the numnah<lb/>
so that the ends hang down, and then folding up the blanket from each<lb/>
side so as to bring several folds under the side bar but no more under the<lb/>
arch, and if the saddle is still not high enough, to put on numnah pannels.<lb/>
If in the field, straw or long coarse grass may be tied on to the side bars,<lb/>
and straw pannels thus made. The most perfect straw pannel can be<lb/>
made from a bottle protector after dividing the string which ties up the<lb/>
narrow end. These are quite readily kept in position on the side bars by<lb/>
string.
</p>

<p>
The methods adopted in dealing with No. 2 are also suitable for No. 3.<lb/>
Loss of back muscle is replaced by pannels of numnah, strips of numnah,<lb/>
extra folds in the blanket under the side bar, but not under the arch, straw<lb/>
pannels, or even straw placed in the folds of the blanket.
</p>

<p>
Anything which will raise the saddle to its proper height above the<lb/>
spine, make a soft bed for it to rest on, and so take the place of the natural<lb/>
muscle bed which has wasted away, will prevent further injury to the<lb/>
withers.
</p>

<p>
In effecting these alterations they must be seen and inspected. No<lb/>
opinion can be given without seeing the man in the saddle ; he should be<lb/>
made to place both hands on the front arch, and bring his entire weight<lb/>
to bear on it before he can be perfectly assured that no further injury is<lb/>
possible.

</p>

<p>
Injury<lb/>
under<lb/>
rear arch.
</p>

<p>
Injuries<lb/>
from<lb/>
side bars.
</p>

<p>
It must not be supposed that every injury on the top or sides of the<lb/>
wither is necessarily due to the cause we have named, but they represent<lb/>
probably 98 per cent. ; the remainder is made up of such causes as the<lb/>
seat sinking and touching the spines of the back, or even resting on them<lb/>
through an insufficient amount of material being beneath the side bar ;<lb/>
the loose end of a strap getting under the arch, a badly fitting horse rug,<lb/>
and similar rare conditions.
</p>

<p>
Injury from surcingles. â An injury to the middle of the back over the<lb/>
spine occurs through trying to keep numnahs or blankets on the back<lb/>
with the overgirth without a pad. The pressure is sometimes so severe<lb/>
as to kill a piece of skin the size of a half-crown. Nothing can be used<lb/>
as a roller unless it has a pad on it. As a fairly useful makeshift, some<lb/>
hay passed under the surcingle on either side of the spine so as to keep it<lb/>
off the ridge of the backbone may be used with advantage.
</p>

<p>
Injury under rear arch. â Injuries in connection with the rear arch<lb/>
and- the portion of blanket and numnah which it covers are not very<lb/>
common. From the rear arch itself no injury is inflicted, but the numnah<lb/>
may cause very considerable inflammation if allowed to come down on<lb/>
the back and get tightly stretched over the spine. Even without getting<lb/>
tightly stretched it may cause considerable trouble due to the stitches<lb/>
which hold the leather patch and strap in position. The remedy to apply<lb/>
in the above case is very obvious.
</p>

<p>
Injuries due to not strapping the rear pack high enough is a fault<lb/>
which is quite unpardonable. It can be seen at a glance whether the spine<lb/>
is free from pressure, and if not, this should be brought under " careless<lb/>
saddling," and made the subject of punishment. In those cases where<lb/>
the pack comes down as the result of loss of condition, no further strapping<lb/>
up is possible. Such cases should be dealt with by placing more folds of<lb/>
blanket under the side bar or by putting on strips of numnah or numuah<lb/>
pannels.
</p>

<p>
The loose end of a baggage strap v/ill do nearly as much harm as the<lb/>
kit resting on the spine.
</p>

<p>
If saddles be used for military purposes without a cantle, or with a very<lb/>
low one, a rear pack can only be carried so long as the horses are in good<lb/>
condition ; after that it must be cast aside, for no pack can be carried<lb/>
behind with a low cantle and impoverished condition.
</p>

<p>
Injuries from sidebars. â These are determined by their position beneath<lb/>
the bar and may occur at any point throughout its length or breadth.
</p>

<p>
We have previously had occasion to deal at such length with the<lb/>
matter of side bars and their fit that there is no necessity to do more than<lb/>
indicate the means to adopt to prevent further injury.

Balance of<lb/>

</p>

<p>
must be so folded as to increase the number of folds under the side bar<lb/>
and reduce those under the arch ; this helps to make the arch wider.
</p>

<p>
Injuries due to the lower edge of the side bar pressing into the back<lb/>
almost invariably occur in the region of the rear arch. They may be<lb/>
dealt with by a process the reverse of the foregoing, viz., strips of numnah<lb/>
along the upper edge of the side bar and an increase in the number of<lb/>
folds of the blanket.
</p>

<p>
In putting on these strips of numnah they require adjusting and care.<lb/>
The side bar should be marked with chalk to ensure they are secured in<lb/>
the right place, and the edge of the numnah should be shaved moderately<lb/>
thin.
</p>

<p>
Injuries due to side bars being too curved occur about the middle of<lb/>
the back, and the curve cannot be reduced, so the only thing is, to fill up<lb/>
both ends of the side bar with strips of numnah, shaving them off to<lb/>
nothing as they approach the centre. More than one strip may be<lb/>
required at the extremities ; in this, as in all other building-up operations<lb/>
with numnah, the personal equation of the operator, his capacity for<lb/>
grasping requirements, and his resourcefulness, make all the difference<lb/>
between success and failure.
</p>

<p>
With pannelled saddles it is comparatively simple to deal with altera-<lb/>
tions ; they generally consist of more stuffing, which only a ' trained<lb/>
saddler can do, or at least no one else attempts, though it is quite simple.
</p>

<p>
With a side bar too curved, more stuffing would be placed fore and aft<lb/>
of the pannel. With one pressing on the blade-bones or loins, the stuffing<lb/>
is taken out of the end of the pannel and the part stitched across to<lb/>
keep it empty (fig. 35).
</p>

<p>
With the edge of the side bar pressing into the back, the stuffing<lb/>
is adjusted so as to raise the impressing edge, but this is not a<lb/>
manoeuvre easy to eftect in a pannel. It is better to place strips of<lb/>
numnah along the side bar (exactly as in the saddle with no pannels),<lb/>
and then fit the pannels on over them.
</p>

<p>
There are injuries caused by side bars which are liable to present<lb/>
difficulty ; they are generally found on the back opposite the position<lb/>
occupied by the rear arch, but an examination of the side bar reveals<lb/>
nothing calculated to give rise to a sore an inch or two in diameter.
</p>

<p>
It is a bad place for an injury ; in fact, excepting the withers, it is<lb/>
the worst seat of trouble. What is its cause ? The cause is the want of<lb/>
proper adjustment in the balance of the weight carried. Some men<lb/>
incline more to one side than the othei*; many men ride with the near<lb/>
stirrup leather longer than the off, and all this means a disturbance in the<lb/>
balance of weight carried. lUit this is not the disturbance we are

<p>
necessarily referring to, but rather to one which is permanent and<lb/>
constant in its action, while the above are irregular and intermittent.<lb/>
A sword and shoe case on the near side of the saddle will not balance<lb/>
the rifle on the opposite side. A nosebag and feed added to the weight<lb/>
of the sword will help matters, but when the feed is eaten the rifle again<lb/>
causes the saddle to heel over, and to press the side bar more deeply<lb/>
into the back.
</p>

<p>
There are few things which require more attention than the question<lb/>
of the balance of weight, pound for pound, ounce for ounce. There<lb/>
should be the same weight on the off side as on the near. In fact, to<lb/>
secure this adjustment it would even be better to add weight to the light<lb/>
side to bring matters into equilibrium, so important is it that the weight<lb/>
on a horse's back should be equal on either side of the spine.
</p>

<p>
The proper adjustment of weight is not a difficult matter, but the<lb/>
patching up of a back injured as we have described is far more difficult.<lb/>
In pannelled saddles a chamber can be made (p. 200), and the sore<lb/>
accommodated ; in those saddles possessing only a blanket, this cannot<lb/>
be done, and short folding of the blanket becomes necessary.
</p>

<p>
When a chamber is made in a pannelled saddle it is essential that<lb/>
nothing (such as a numnah) should be worn between the back and the<lb/>
chamber, or else the injury is aggravated.
</p>

<p>
In determining side bar injuries and how caused, the bare tree How to<lb/>
should be placed on the back, but held at such a height above it as will examine<lb/>
correspond to the thickness of the numnah and blanket. If this |JÂ°^ ^^"^<lb/>
precaution be not adopted, the side bars will occupy a lower position on injuries<lb/>
the back than they did when the blanket and numnah were beneath,<lb/>
and our localisation of the cause of the trouble will be wholly wrong.<lb/>
For example, suppose we are examining a back injured by the upper<lb/>
edge of the side bar, and place the bare tree on the back, it will be found<lb/>
that the upper edge of the bar is an inch below the injury on the back ;<lb/>
but if we raise the tree at a sufficient height to allow for the thickness of<lb/>
blanket and numnah, the upper edge of the side bar will then correspond<lb/>
with the wound.
</p>

<p>
The fans of the side bar capable of inflicting injury on the loins, Injuries<lb/>
the result of friction. The rolling action of the loins, previously ^^^^ ^^"â¢<lb/>
described (p. 169), causes friction between them and the side bar. Very<lb/>
little contact suffices ; the hair, as the result of friction, is shaved off as<lb/>
closely as if done by a razor, and over a patch the size of the palm of the<lb/>
hand.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally the matter ends there ; the oval-shorn patch remains,<lb/>
but undergoes no further change ; if, however, the rear fans press on the

<p>
loins with more force than is sufficient to shave the hair off, the next<lb/>
stage is a crop of pimples, heat and swelling, and the loins become<lb/>
extremely tender.<lb/>
Remedy. The remedy for the above-described state of affairs is very simple, the
</p>

<p>
principle being that the fans are to be kept off the loins, either by extra<lb/>
folds in the blanket, or a numnah panel. The thickness of either of these<lb/>
must be such that the fans are raised off the loins to such a height that<lb/>
the hand may find ready admission beneath them when the man is in<lb/>
the saddle and leaning back.
</p>

<p>
This is also a case where the blanket should be folded shorter.
</p>

<p>
So far, the injuries described have been mainly due to the saddle<lb/>
itself, but there are others caused by the appendages of the saddle, viz.,<lb/>
the girth, rifle bucket, shoe case, and rear pack.<lb/>
Girth- Girth-galls. â Girth-galls have been referred to (p. 176), in dealing
</p>

<p>
galls. ys\\h the influence of make and shape in the production of saddle injuries.
</p>

<p>
As there noticed, the horse with the shallow up-running brisket, especially<lb/>
if associated with bulging curved ribs, is sure to girth-gall ; his saddle<lb/>
works forward, as there is nothing to keep it in its place, and apart<lb/>
from other inconveniences, the elbow gets galled from the friction of the<lb/>
edge of the girth.
</p>

<p>
Horses will also gall that are in soft condition : it is one of the first<lb/>
troubles affecting a remount on beginning its military training, but<lb/>
ceases as soon as he improves in condition. This should be borne in<lb/>
mind, and girths not structurally altered under the impression that these<lb/>
are to blame ; all that is necessary is to put a piece of sheepskin<lb/>
around the girth until improvement in condition sets in.
</p>

<p>
Many horses learn the trick of keeping their chests distended with<lb/>
air when they are being girthed up, or, as it is commonly expressed,<lb/>
"blowing themselves out."
</p>

<p>
The object with which this is done is to avoid being tightly girthed<lb/>
up ; such should always have their girths tightened after the man<lb/>
mounts, and all, as a rule, require the girths tightening after they have<lb/>
been out a little time.
</p>

<p>
Especially is this the case on the line of march, for under these<lb/>
circumstances the horses are carrying a greater' weight, and it is of<lb/>
the utmost importance it should rock as little as possilDle. A loose<lb/>
girth for a soldier's horse is on this account a great mistake.
</p>

<p>
We must always remember that a saddle is never girthed to a back as<lb/>
tightly as it seems ; when a man's weight is in the saddle the girths at<lb/>
once i3ecome slacker.
</p>

<p>
The action of string, hide and canvas girths has been discussed (p. 176).

<p>
The most troublesome of all girth-galls is that which arises from How to<lb/>
malformation, viz., the shallow brisket and arched ribs, and if such keep back<lb/>
horses are used for riding purposes, the only way to keep the saddle in Â»^<lb/>
its place is by strapping the girth back ; this is carried out as follows : â
</p>

<p>
The surcingle is placed under the seat towards the rear arch, and<lb/>
passed obliquely under the belly and buckled, the buckle being under<lb/>

taken and passed between the girth and the skin covering the brisket,

and then under the surcingle, which should be about a foot from the<lb/>
rear of the girth, or even further back than this (fig. 37). The saddle<lb/>
girth can now be drawn back as far as is considered necessary to avoid<lb/>
the injured surface ; when this is accomplished the girth is drawn tight.<lb/>
The surcingle is also tightened, but only sufficiently to prevent it from<lb/>
being drawn forwards. With this contrivance it is impossible for a horse<lb/>
to girth-gall, and impossible for a saddle to slip forward.
</p>

<p>
The use of a V-shaped girth is a considerable gain to the troop horse,<lb/>
but the point of junction of the V is always a source of trouble ; a metal<lb/>
union appears to be necessary for strength, but a metal plate, ring, or<lb/>
studs at this point are a possible source of trouble, especially if a blanket<lb/>
be so folded as not to afford sufficient protection to the sides. Nor must<lb/>
it be forgotten that the cause of trouble Is aggravated by a tight<lb/>
surcingle or over-girth. The action of this is to press the metal<lb/>
connection deeper into the side, and in some cases a tight over-girth is<lb/>
the sole cause of trouble.
</p>

<p>
Conformation has an effect ; the flat-ribbed horse suffers more than<lb/>
the other. The remedy is simple : one or more pads of numnah<lb/>
under the attachment, depending upon the horse's conformation, will<lb/>
prevent any further bruising of the sides, while the over-girth must be left<lb/>
slack.
</p>

<p>
Quite apart from the metal attachment on the V-shaped girth, injury<lb/>
may arise from the buckles on the girth. It is easy to ascertain the<lb/>
cause of this injury, as the abrasion corresponds to the holes in the girth<lb/>
straps. The remedy is simple : a pad of numnah above the injury, and<lb/>
girthing the horse two holes lower on the affected side will be found<lb/>
sufficient.
</p>

<p>
Injury f 7-0 m the rear pack. â Injuries from the rear pack are among<lb/>
some of the most severe inflicted ; the part affected is the ridge of<lb/>
the spine where there is nothing covering the bone but skin, and in a<lb/>
very short time an injury may be inflicted of sufficient severity to lay<lb/>
the horse up for weeks. No matter what is carried behind the saddle the<lb/>
golden rule is that it should be concave towards the spine in order that<lb/>
nothing may touch it. The nature of the material carried must determine<lb/>
what degree of bend can be given to it to make it concave towards the<lb/>
spine. For instance, when one sees a picket peg laid across the rear fans<lb/>
and carried next to the horse's back we know that the golden rule for<lb/>
carrying a rear pack is either unknown or forgotten.
</p>

<p>
Bearing in mind what we have said about muscle waste, it must be<lb/>
evident that a rear pack which is clear of the spine when the horse is<lb/>
full of muscle may rest on the backbone when he loses flesh. A horse

</p>

<p>
with a roach back is at all times more liable to this class of injury than<lb/>
one with a back of ordinary shape.
</p>

<p>
It is obvious that the danger of carrying material behind the saddle<lb/>
is enormously increased by using a saddle with a low cantle ; in fact, it<lb/>
may at once be said that low cantle saddles, such as find their way<lb/>
into military service under the stress of war, should never be used for<lb/>
carrying a rear pack when the animals have lost muscle. No matter<lb/>
what may constitute the rear pack, it should be so fitted that when the<lb/>
man is in the saddle and leaning back the closed hand should find easy<lb/>
admission between the pack and the spine, and on the march and on<lb/>
service this point should be looked to every day. A single glance riding<lb/>
behind the men will at once tell the trained eye whether everything is<lb/>
satisfactory.
</p>

<p>
A rear pack must not be slack in its attachment to the cantle, but<lb/>
firm and immovable ; all buckles must be on top and in sight, for a buckle<lb/>
resting on the spine is a real source of trouble, while the loose end of<lb/>
a strap is productive of considerable injury if it finds its way under the<lb/>
numnah. All buckles and free ends of straps must be in view.
</p>

<p>
There is a time-honoured custom in the service not to remove saddles Removal<lb/>
while the backs are hot, but to loosen the girth and let the back dry with of saddlery<lb/>
the saddle on. Sometimes the saddle is taken off and merely the ^^^^ Â°^<lb/>
numnah left on, and this is the right method. Every endeavour should<lb/>
be made to dry backs as soon as possible. If wet backs are exposed to<lb/>
the air it is not uncommon for many small swellings to form, which, as<lb/>
a rule, go down in a few hours, but occasionally become fairly permanent<lb/>
and get rubbed.
</p>

<p>
In some parts of the world, like South Africa, no care is taken to Atmos-<lb/>
prevent hot and wet backs being exposed, and no harm results ; but the phenc<lb/>
conditions of atmosphere are very different from what is found in Europe, copd'tions<lb/>
the air being dry and evaporation rapid. In Europe we think it a good ^^cks.<lb/>
precautionary measure not to expose the backs until the men are ready to<lb/>
dry them.
</p>

<p>
As horses get in hard condition the sweating under the saddle becomes<lb/>
less until finally hardly any moisture can be seen. This is a useful guide<lb/>
to the hard condition of troop horses.
</p>

<p>
A sand bath for both horses and mules after being on duty is an Sand bath<lb/>
excellent thing ; the animals roll and refresh themselves, and in this to dry<lb/>
way, among other advantages, dry their own backs. backs.

<p>
How TO Examine a Sore Back.
</p>

<p>
Sore backs Sore backs may be classified into those affecting the ridge of the<lb/>
classified, back-bone, viz., the withers and spine, and those occurring on the skin<lb/>
covering the muscles which lie on the top of the ribs. To put it in another<lb/>
way, there are sore backs affecting primarily the bony structures, and<lb/>
others which only affect the soft parts ; the former are incomparably the<lb/>
most severe.
</p>

<p>
A very little experience will show that sore backs appear to group<lb/>
themselves in certain definite positions, and these positions are not<lb/>
accidental but the outcome of certain definite causes.
</p>

<p>
So marked is this, that with experience it is possible to tell the<lb/>
cause of an injury by its position on the back, and to forecast the<lb/>
part of the saddle which produced it. But the inexperienced should be<lb/>
careful to avoid this system, as there are few things so deceptive as to<lb/>
judge by the eye alone the position on the back which any portion of<lb/>
the saddle lies opposite to. No one can be convinced of the difficulty<lb/>
without previously making a simple observation.
</p>

<p>
Take a horse with no saddle on and mark on the back with a dab<lb/>
of wet pipe-clay the position of the rear arch where it rests on the side<lb/>
bar ; or the position the stirrup leather passes through, or indicate<lb/>
on the side the place where the two girth straps meet or the shoe case<lb/>
rests.<lb/>
To It is astonishing how large the error will be when the saddle is put on

<p>
determine the back and the actual spot compared with the suggested one.<lb/>
position of yi^g j-ule, therefore, is never to guess at the cause of a sore back, or<lb/>
order alterations to be made in a saddle without seeing it on, and<lb/>
convincing oneself that no error in position exists.
</p>

<p>
Here is a table showing the causes of sore back, which should be<lb/>
read in conjunction with fig. 36, where the position of the injuries is<lb/>
given.<lb/>

<p>
due to the roller being too tight. Grooms in a private stable<lb/>
pull the body roller tight to keep the blanket in its place, and<lb/>
if the pad of the roller is old, the roller itself comes down on<lb/>
the spine and produces injury.
</p>

<p>
In those blankets where the roller is stitched to the blanket<lb/>
and no pad used, the stitching which confines the roller to the<lb/>
blanket may be sufficiently coarse to produce injury. More<lb/>
commonly it is due to the roller being too tight, and this will<lb/>
occur on the picket line after a heavy dew. In such cases<lb/>
the roller is so tight as to be unbuckled with great difficulty.
</p>

<p>
When the saddle surcingle is used to keep on a blanket, it<lb/>
is a common source of injury ; it is always so tightly drawn<lb/>
that if without a pad it cuts its way into the skin and if v/ith<lb/>
a pad the latter so soon flattens under compression that the<lb/>
surcingle is not kept off the spine.<lb/>
No surcingle should be used without a roller, and if none is. avail-<lb/>
able, straw, grass, hay, or stable rubbers should be placed under<lb/>
it, close to the spine on either side, so as to save the ridge of<lb/>
the spine.

girthing, but especially tight over-girthing. It may be pro-<lb/>
duced by any pattern of V-shaped girth, or by the buckles on<lb/>
ordinary girths, though, as a rule, when the latter occurs, it<lb/>
is due to thin pannel flaps.<lb/>
From what has been said, it is obvious that the cause of a sore To<lb/>
back can only be determined by seeing the saddle on. It is most determine<lb/>
desirable that saddling should be done by the man who rides the horse, gQ^^ -^^"^

relation to for in that way we are more likely to see matters as they occurred,<lb/>
side bar. Everything being in position and the girths loose, the hand is passed<lb/>
palm downwards to the seat of trouble, and when the wound can be<lb/>
felt with the tops of the fingers the hand is turned over, the palm now<lb/>
being upwards, and the fingers resting on that part of the numnah or<lb/>
pannel opposite to the injury. The place should at once be marked by<lb/>
chalk or pencil. An examination must then be made of everything<lb/>
in the region of this mark, especially of the saddletree.
</p>

<p>
It frequently happens that the position of a wound on the back is<lb/>
such that the hand cannot be passed to it in the manner just described.<lb/>
In such cases the wound has some simple colouring matter applied to<lb/>
it in the form of an ointment â a Httle vaseline or lard will do admir-<lb/>
ably â and the saddle carefully placed on the back. The part corre-<lb/>
sponding to the injury will in this way be accurately indicated.
</p>

<p>
The same process should be employed in order to indicate the exact<lb/>
position of a chamber.
</p>

<p>
Where pannels are used, be they for riding or pack saddles, the<lb/>
leather surface is a wonderful help in determining the cause of injury,<lb/>
for the leather takes the imprint of the tree with all its irregularities,<lb/>
so that a study of the outer surface of a pannel tells a tale which can<lb/>
be read by the trained eye as easily as a book.
</p>

<p>
Even the surface of the blanket in contact with the saddletree<lb/>
carries, as we have seen, the imprint of the tree for a few minutes after<lb/>
the saddle is removed and gives time for its inspection.
</p>

<p>
What the imprint on either pannel or blanket tells us is this : it shows<lb/>
beyond all doubt whether the pressure of the bar is evenly distributed<lb/>
from front to rear and from upper to lower edge. If at some places a<lb/>
deep depression exists, while at others the imprint of the bar is scarcely<lb/>
seen, then it is evident that the weight is being carried on those points<lb/>
where the depressions exist, and the part of the back corresponding to<lb/>
these may in consequence be found damaged. The careful study of<lb/>
saddle imprints is a wonderful help in determining the cause of trouble.
</p>

<p>
Pack Saddles.
</p>

<p>
The general principle of pack saddle construction is much the same<lb/>
as that of a riding saddle, viz., a front and rear arch and a pair of side<lb/>
bars. The metal arches are much stronger than in a riding saddle, and<lb/>
provided with a pair of hooks to which the load is attached.
</p>

<p>
Pannels are invariably used with pack saddles ; nothing can take<lb/>
their place. They are large, square in shape, and stuffed with horsehair,
</p>

<p>
the lining being of serge or linen. The girths are two in number, and Girths,<lb/>
in order to keep the saddle in its place going up or down hill, a breast-<lb/>
piece, quarter-piece and crupper are used.
</p>

<p>
The weight of all this is considerable ; in fact, the unloaded equipment Weight,<lb/>
is a load in itself, the pack saddle being about one-quarter of the total<lb/>
load. How far this is absolutely essential is a debatable point. In<lb/>
countries where pack transport is a general feature, light pack saddles<lb/>
are not unknown. But it must be remembered that the military load is<lb/>
somethmg very different from that of merchandise ; it is either a<lb/>
concentrated weight such as a pair of ammunition boxes or a machine<lb/>
gun, or it is a bulky load like entrenching tools, tents, men's<lb/>
kits, &amp;c., and such loads require a strong saddle.
</p>

<p>
Transport animals for pack purposes are usually mules and ponies, Mules and<lb/>
and the selection of either of these is a matter of considerable moment, ponies for<lb/>
In the question of fitting and subsequent safety, the mule with a ^^ ,<lb/>
straight back, low withers, and upright shoulders is an ideal formation compared<lb/>
for a pack saddle, and the make or shape of a number of mules' backs<lb/>
are not liable to great variation. With ponies this is otherwise, and<lb/>
their variations in formation are nearly as considerable as in the<lb/>
horse.
</p>

<p>
The general principles of fitting a pack saddle differ very slightly Principles<lb/>
from that of the horse ; the spine must be entirely free from pressure, of fitting<lb/>
the saddle must bear on the top of the ribs, the side bars should not rest P^^|^.<lb/>
either on the loins or the blade-bones, though for obvious reasons more ^^<lb/>
of this is permissible in the mule than in the horse and pony. The load<lb/>
should be kept as steady as possible, for which reason two girths at a little<lb/>
distance apart keep the saddle firmly in its place.
</p>

<p>
The thick wither of the mule is frequently a difficulty, the arch of the<lb/>
saddle in many cases not being sufficiently wide to admit the pannels<lb/>
without the withers getting squeezed. In fitting pack saddles this is one<lb/>
of the essential features to attend to, and the one which most frequently is<lb/>
found defective.
</p>

<p>
Of equal importance with a good wide front arch is a pair of well-<lb/>
stuffed pannels. The amount of stuffing depends on the amount of<lb/>
muscle on the back, but assuming the back is well and liberally clothed<lb/>
with flesh the pannels still need well stuffing, as their function is not<lb/>
only to prevent the back from getting bruised but to endeavour to convert<lb/>
a dead weight into an elastic one.
</p>

<p>
It is unnecessary and undesirable, if the animal is short in the back,<lb/>
to stuff the pannels for the full length ; in this way shoulder-blade and<lb/>
hip injuries may be avoided, the latter being particularly common.
</p>

<p>
The length of the back from the pit of the shoulder to a hand's<lb/>
breadth in front of the point of the hip should be the length of the<lb/>
bearing surface of the pannel. More than this is harmful. This fitting<lb/>
can be effected by maiking off the length on the pannel and stitching it<lb/>
across (see fig. 35), after having previously pressed the stuffing out to<lb/>
the required distance at each extremity.
</p>

<p>
If a pack saddle is â
</p>

<p>
(i) Wide in the front arch and sufficiently high,
</p>

<p>
(2) with pannels stuffed to correspond with the length of the back,
</p>

<p>
(3) thick enough to form an elastic bed ;
</p>

<p>
this is all the fitting required.
</p>

<p>
It is not intended that the side bars should be fitted as in the horse.<lb/>
There is no such thing as securing the fit of the tree other than the<lb/>
above condition respecting the front arch. The tree of a pack saddle is<lb/>
a mere matter of convenience to hang the load on ; the essential feature<lb/>
is the pannel, and to this it is impossible to pay too much attention. The<lb/>
fitting of a pack saddle is therefore much simpler than that of a riding<lb/>
saddle.<lb/>
Injuries Injuries from pack saddles.â The. injuries resulting from pack saddles
</p>

<p>
^'^ h"hi ^^^^ ^'â¢^ Â°^ ^^^ same type as those caused by riding saddles and brought about<lb/>
^^ ^^* in the same way, viz., dead continuous pressure or friction. In this way<lb/>
are produced inflamed withers from narrow arches, injuries under the<lb/>
side bar the result of thin pannels and too many hours under heavy<lb/>
loads ; injuries to the shoulder-blades and hips due to the pannels being<lb/>
too long, all of which are remedied by removing the cause. But the<lb/>
load itself may be a source of injury, some of the projecting impedimenta<lb/>
may wound the withers or neck, other portions sticking out behind may<lb/>
inflict injuries on the hips, oscillation of the load will bruise the back<lb/>
through actual concussion, while a want of equilibrium will cause the<lb/>
saddle to heel over and cause injury to the withers and ridge of the back.<lb/>
These causes are all capable of control ; no load should project in<lb/>
such a way as to touch any part of the body ; an animal should be<lb/>
capable of trotting and turning to either hand without being interfered<lb/>
with by the impedimenta, and both these tests should be employed when<lb/>
in doubt. Transport animals should not, of course, trot, but mules may<lb/>
be employed carrying entrenching tools and such-like, and must on<lb/>
occasion be able to move quickly. A trot finds out many defects, and<lb/>
the attitude of the body is so different from that of a walk that parts<lb/>
which appear out of harm's way at the latter pace are found to be<lb/>
dangerously close or even touching at the trot, and especially is this true of

<p>
the neck. The oscillation of the load is due to bad packing, a web<lb/>
surcingle should envelop the entire load and keep it secure to the<lb/>
animal's body and so avoid swaying.
</p>

<p>
A want of equilibrium in a load is a most serious source of trouble, Balance<lb/>
and one which a few moments' attention would rectify. If an animal o^ w'eight.<lb/>
has a pack of 100 lbs. to carry it is certain he will carry it with more<lb/>
ease, less expenditure of energy, and with less risk of injury if it is so<lb/>
disposed that 50 lbs. hang on either side of the body than if one load<lb/>
weighs 52 lbs. and the other 48 lbs. When the difference in weight is<lb/>
ten or even twenty pounds the risk of injury is enormously increased.<lb/>
Badly arranged loads, or what is more common, the thoughtlessness of<lb/>
soldiers, largely account for this want of equilibrium ; when all<lb/>
the odds and ends left on a camping ground are hung indiscriminately<lb/>
on the nearest mules, and the baggage guard hang their rifles on any<lb/>
available projection in the load, the disturbance of balance can be readily<lb/>
understood. Of such supreme importance is the matter of load<lb/>
equilibrium that it would be far better to add a stone or a packet of sand<lb/>
to the light side rather than permit unequal loads to exist ; but as a<lb/>
rule this is unnecessary, the picketing gear, nosebag, &amp;c., of the mule<lb/>
is always available for small adjustments. The transport animals of an<lb/>
army shall be regarded as worth their weight in gold, no care or super-<lb/>
vision can be too great or too strict. The eye of a transport officer<lb/>
cannot be everywhere in a column extending for miles, but arrangements<lb/>
should be made for dividing it into sections for the purpose of supervision,<lb/>
which latter must be constant and unremitting, taking cognisance of<lb/>
badly fitting harness, saddles, badly adjusted loads, overdriving,<lb/>
unauthorized loads, ungreased wheels, flogging and other irregularities<lb/>
which go to swell the unenviable lot of a transport animal.
</p>

<p>
At this point it may be convenient to briefly enumerate the conditions Essential<lb/>
which are essential in loading pack transport. points in
</p>

<p>
1. The load should be carried as far as possible over the tops of the p^^^i^
</p>

<p>
ribs and as little as possible over the sides of them. Every transport,<lb/>
endeavour should be made to avoid compressing the sides, for<lb/>
not only is the load carried at a disadvantage if placed low down,<lb/>
but it interferes with the breathing.
</p>

<p>
2. A very high load is disadvantageous as it sways backwards and
</p>

<p>
forwards during progression.
</p>

<p>
3. No load should touch an animal's body ; if it extends in front of
</p>

<p>
or behind the pack saddle it should be quite clear of the<lb/>
shoulders and hips.

</p>

<p>
4. Loads cannot be too flat ; the flatter they are the closer they He
</p>

<p>
to the saddle and the less oscillation.
</p>

<p>
5. Loose girths are a serious evil, so also is a slack surcingle ; the
</p>

<p>
former allows the saddle to oscillate, the latter permits the load<lb/>
to sway about.
</p>

<p>
The alterations to a pack saddle which has produced injury are not<lb/>
difficult. From what has been said it must be determined whether there<lb/>
is any fault actually present in the saddle, or whether it is a case of<lb/>
unskilful adjustment of the load. For our present purpose we shall assume<lb/>
the saddle is at fault, though the latter is, perhaps, more common.
</p>

<p>
Injuries to the withers can only be from the arch being too low or too
</p>

<p>
narrow ; the former is rare, the latter common. A low arch damages the
</p>

<p>
top of the withers, a narrow arch pinches the sides. There is no other
</p>

<p>
remedy for the latter but to change the saddle for one wider in the arch.
</p>

<p>
Chamber- Chamberi7ig pa7i7iels. â All injuries arising from the side bars or load
</p>

<p>
'"^ are remedied through the pannel, either by increasing the stuffing if the
</p>

<p>
panne s. p^nnels are thin, or by chambering them. A chamber is a depression
</p>

<p>
in the pannel intended to take all bearing off a tender or injured place.
</p>

<p>
It is a method of the highest value, but requires intelligence to direct its
</p>

<p>
utility.
</p>

<p>
It seems a mere truism to say that a chamber must correspond to<lb/>
the position of the injury, yet this is one of the most common faults in<lb/>
connection with them ; they do not correspond, or not with that accuracy<lb/>
which is essential. They require to protect the wound and the tender<lb/>
region around it, and this can only be secured by most careful fitting. A<lb/>
chamber badly placed is more than useless.
</p>

<p>
The position of a chamber is ascertained by looking at the mark of<lb/>
blood on the pannel ; or if there is no stain the injury should be lightly<lb/>
covered with lard or vaseline, the saddle put accurately in its place, girthed<lb/>
up, and then removed. The mark on the pannel tells us all we require<lb/>
to know. The part is then indicated with pencil for the guidance of the<lb/>
saddler, and his work consists in stitching around this mark, after having<lb/>
first removed the stuffing completely from the area, and finally pushing<lb/>
the stuffing up against the stitches, so that a concavity is formed as<lb/>
deep as the pannel is thick.
</p>

<p>
A chamber can be made in a few minutes by anyone with sufficient<lb/>
intelligence to push a needle through leather ; as a rule it is left to the<lb/>
saddler, but only the technical work should fall to an already fully<lb/>
occupied artificer. Every non-commissioned officer connected with<lb/>
transport should be able to chamber a pack saddle, and have the needful<lb/>
appliances by him.

SADDLES AND SORE BACKS. 201
</p>

<p>
The stitching around the chamber must be sufficiently close to<lb/>
prevent the stuffing finding its way between them into the chamber, and<lb/>
the hair must be pressed well up against the stitches in order to keep the<lb/>
chamber deep.
</p>

<p>
A chamber once made requires looking to daily ; every time the<lb/>
saddle is taken off it should be inspected to ascertain that the sore is<lb/>
not pressed upon, for the tendency of all pannels is to become thinner<lb/>
under compression, and as they get thinner the chamber gradually becomes<lb/>
obliterated or nearly so. It would not be possible to make a useful<lb/>
chamber in a thin pannel without adding stuffing.
</p>

<p>
Pannels naturally settle down more when they are in a new state than<lb/>
after they have been in use some time ; the compression a new pannel<lb/>
undergoes has to be seen to be appreciated ; the hair gradually works<lb/>
itself into a close felted cake, and to prevent this going too far pannels<lb/>
are occasionally pricked up with an instrument like an awl ; this can only<lb/>
be done by a saddler.
</p>

<p>
The golden rule in dealing with pannels should be never to interfere<lb/>
with them unless they require it, for a pannel soon takes the impression<lb/>
of the part on which it rests, and in this way adjusts itself to the slope<lb/>
of the back. To disturb this unnecessarily would be a mistake.
</p>

<p>
Numnahs are not used with pack saddles ; the function of any<lb/>
numnah is to prevent the sweat from the animal passing into the pannel<lb/>
or blanket. It is, perhaps, unfortunate that some means is not adopted<lb/>
to keep the lining of pack saddles clean, for caking occurs on the pannels<lb/>
through wet and accumulation of filth from the skin, and in consequence<lb/>
they get dry and hard. They can be cleaned by drying, brushing, and<lb/>
beating lightly with a stick.
</p>

<p>
Collars and Sore Shoulders.
</p>

<p>
It will assist considerably in understanding the horse's requirements<lb/>
in collar fitting if we study very briefly the shape of the shoulders and<lb/>
the movements they undergo.
</p>

<p>
Movement of shoulders. â We have seen (p. 158) that the shoulder Move-<lb/>
blades are constantly moving backwards and forwards. For the ment of<lb/>
purpose of collar fitting we have to bear in mind that while one shoulder shoulders,<lb/>
is coming forward, the other is going backward, so that at no time is the<lb/>
collar resting on a perfectly parallel surface â such as the two shoulders<lb/>
at rest represent â but always on an oblique one. This backward and<lb/>
forward movement produces considerable oscillation in a collar, which<lb/>
may readily be seen by leading a horse along with the collar lying on the

<p>
shoulders. This oscillation, the result of the movement of the shoulders,<lb/>
is a most important point to remember if we are to understand how<lb/>
collar injuries are produced. â¢
</p>

<p>
A horse with an upright shoulder is comparatively easy to fit with a<lb/>
collar, especially if the draught place is wide ; but an animal possessing<lb/>
oblique shoulders is difficult to fit, for the part is fine, there being no<lb/>
draught place, and the tendency is for the collar to rise on the shoulders<lb/>
when the horse puts his weight into it.
</p>

<p>
No matter what shape a shoulder may be, the collar invariably<lb/>
rises when in draught, though with upright shoulders only to a limited<lb/>
extent.
</p>

<p>
Necks and shoulders vary in shape and size depending on the
</p>

<p>
amount of condition present ; this, as will be seen presently, is the
</p>

<p>
key-note to collar fitting and the prevention of injuries. Some horses
</p>

<p>
are very thick at the crest of the neck, others are thin ; some have the
</p>

<p>
neck so hollow from side to side that it can almost be felt through, whilst
</p>

<p>
others have the muscles large and well developed.
</p>

<p>
Where the Where the draught is placed. â We know that the weight imparted
</p>

<p>
draught is ^q ^ horse's shoulders in draught should be evenly distributed over the
</p>

<p>
P ^^^ ' anterior surface of the bladebone ; owing to the movements of the
</p>

<p>
shoulders, the collar should fit so closely that but little oscillation is
</p>

<p>
possible between it and the parts beneath. Collar injuries are nearly
</p>

<p>
always the result of friction ; this is the great distinction between
</p>

<p>
them and injuries to the back, which are nearly always the result of
</p>

<p>
i)i'essure ; our object, therefore, is to reduce the friction to a minimum.
</p>

<p>
When a horse throws his weight into the collar, the latter rises on the<lb/>
shoulders especially in draught up hill, hence the necessity for having<lb/>
the throat of the collar away from the neck so that no undue pressure is<lb/>
caused. A collar too deep, viz., too long, rises unduly on the shoulders<lb/>
and extra friction is produced.<lb/>
Fitting a Fitting a collar. â In fitting a collar the following are the points to
</p>

<p>
^^ ^'^' attend to. The collar should lie easily on the shoulders ; no effort should
</p>

<p>
be required to force it into its place â such would be an indication of it<lb/>
being too narrow, and the sides of the neck would suffer. We should<lb/>
observe that it rests evenly on the shoulders from top to bottom ; no<lb/>
see-saw motion should be present, which would indicate that the centre<lb/>
of the body contained too much stuffing. The top part of the collar just<lb/>
in front of the withers should admit the fiat of the hand between it and<lb/>
the neck.
</p>

<p>
The next important step in fitting is to ascertain that the collar fits<lb/>
closely to the side of the neck without pinching ; between the inside of the

SADDLES AND SORE BACKS. 203
</p>

<p>
collar and the neck should be a space which will admit no more than the<lb/>
flat of the fingers, and this space should be found from top to bottom. It<lb/>
will often be observed that the required space exists above, but from the<lb/>
lower third of the neck the space between it and the inside of the collar<lb/>
is so great that it may admit a cricket ball ; in other words, there is too<lb/>
much play. Nothing is more certain than this will produce injury if the<lb/>
animal be called upon to perform heavy and continuous draught work.<lb/>
The secret in collar fitting is to stop all lateral movenie7it bettueen the<lb/>
collar ajid the side of the neck if shoulders are to be kept sound ; on the<lb/>
other hand, pinching the side of the neck is to be avoided. To test the<lb/>
amount of lateral movement in the collar, take hold of the points with<lb/>
one hand and steady the collar on the shoulders ; with the other hand<lb/>
take hold of the throat, then work the collar from side to side, but still<lb/>
pressing it against the shoulders. The amount of play can now be seen.<lb/>
If above the shoulder joint it amounts to as much as two inches, the<lb/>
collar is too wide ; in some cases it is as much as four or five inches.
</p>

<p>
The next thing to be considered is the depth of the collar. From the<lb/>
foregoing it is clear that a collar too deep is a positive evil, one not deep<lb/>
enough may be a source of very serious trouble. To test the depth of<lb/>
a collar, insert the flat of the hand between the throat of the collar and<lb/>
the horse's neck ; if deep enough the hand and wrist should find ready<lb/>
admission ; anything more than this is unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
There is one more point to be examined before our fitting is complete,<lb/>
and that is in connection with the after-wale. When a collar has been<lb/>
in wear for some time the body becomes flatter ; this flattening allows<lb/>
the edge of the after-wale in heavy draught to overlap the body of the<lb/>
collar and cut the skin of the shoulder. We shall again draw attention<lb/>
to this condition, and at present only note that on pressing the collar<lb/>
closely against the shoulders a careful examination of the after-wale<lb/>
should be made just above the point of the shoulder to ascertain that it<lb/>
is nowhere near the skin.
</p>

<p>
To summarise these points in fitting a collar â See Essential
</p>

<p>
1. that it does not rest on the neck in front of the withers ;
</p>

<p>
2. that it bears evenly over the shoulder blades ;
</p>

<p>
3. that the space between the inside of the body of the collar and
</p>

<p>
the neck will admit the fingers and nothing more ;
</p>

<p>
4. that the depth between the throat and the neck will admit hand
</p>

<p>
and wrist.
</p>

<p>
New collars. â A new collar is worse than a new saddle, because it is New<lb/>
only by a certain amount of wear that we can expect this contrivance of collars.

if possible be avoided.
</p>

<p>
To assist a collar in getting into shape, advantage may arise from<lb/>
the following procedure, viz., to thoroughly wet the collar by leaving it in<lb/>
water for an hour or two and then putting it on and working the horse<lb/>
steadily, taking care that its shape is not altered while drying.

now be found too tight When hames are fixed, the rigidity of the collar is<lb/>
considerably increased, and the points are brought much closer together ;<lb/>
it is on this fact that, as we have said, saddlers often depend for keeping<lb/>
the collar closed. But it will be found that the hames only close the<lb/>
collar at the points and not behind ; this can only be effected by a<lb/>
good-fitting housing strap ; the latter cannot be too tightly drawn.<lb/>
Especially is this the case in pole draught as the chains straining on the<lb/>
collar cause considerable strain on the housing strap, especially going<lb/>
down-hill or in pulling-up on the level. For this reason the most<lb/>
common injury in pole draught is to the neck in front of the withers, and<lb/>
few horses escape the mane being worn away at this part, as the result<lb/>
of the continuous friction of the collar. In consequence, we strongly<lb/>
urge the necessity for all collars being so stuffed as to cause no pressure<lb/>
on the neck. (See fig. 38.)
</p>

<p>
Size of collars. â The following description of the collar is taken from Size of<lb/>
the " Handbook for Military Artificers " :â collars.
</p>

<p>
" There is but one pattern of collar for all services ; they vary in size<lb/>
from 19 inches to 24 inches in length. The length is measured from<lb/>
E to F, fig. 39.
</p>

<p>
"The collars most commonly used are 21-inch, 21^-inch, 22-inch,<lb/>
22|-inch, 23-inch, 23|-inch, and 24-inch.

" The fore- wale is made of leather stuffed with straw and capped with<lb/>
light hide. The after-wale is of stout hide, and it covers the body of the<lb/>

</p>

<p>
The bulk of a collar is a question of some importance ; it cannot well<lb/>
be too big in the body ; this ensures the pull of the load being distributed<lb/>
over a large surface. In this respect we may take some useful hints<lb/>
from civil life, where the collars are bulky, and utility is not sacrificed to<lb/>
appearance.

<p>
with great difficulty ; not uncommonly the skin dies and a piece comes<lb/>
away as in a sore back. It is the only approach to a " sitfast " that<lb/>
is met with in collar injuries, and for the reason previously specified,<lb/>
viz., pressure. This injury is more common in pole than in shaft<lb/>
draught, and is caused by the strain inflicted on the neck in pulling up<lb/>
or in going down hill owing to the pull of the pole chains, aggravated<lb/>
by a loose housing strap. The injury may occur on perfectly level roads.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
and is then often due to carelessness on the part of the driver in<lb/>
shortening the pole chains too much, and so throwing the weight of the<lb/>
pole on the horses' necks. The pole should not rest on the neck, but be<lb/>
perfectly free to move up and down, and the chain, though taut, should<lb/>
not lift the pole an inch."^ A tight wither strap, by drawing back the<lb/>
collar, may also cause an injury to the neck.

If collars are stuffed as in fig. 38, this injury may be prevented, or a<lb/>
metal pad may be worn between the neck and the collar. These so-called

</p>

<p>
" wither pads" are undoubtedly excellent, though, of course, they cannot<lb/>
prevent injury when the full strain comes on the neck. In the Belgian<lb/>
system of pole draught, the strain of going down hill or pulling up is not<lb/>
imparted to the collar but to the breeching, which by being carried all<lb/>
round the horse and attached to the pole chains, throws the strain on to<lb/>
a part calculated to take it, viz., the hind quarters.
</p>

<p>
Injury No. 2 is almost invariably due to a tight collar, especially<lb/>
in horses with very fleshy necks ; the remedy is simpleâ remove<lb/>
some of the stuffing or stretch the collar. In stretching a collar<lb/>
it should be borne in mind that there is a risk of damaging it, especially<lb/>
at the throat. It is no use stretchmg a collar without altering the hames,<lb/>
if these are too straight the collar will continue to pinch.
</p>

<p>
Injury No. 3 is practically always due to a loose collar, viz., one too<lb/>
wide ; it is a very common gall and frequently occurs under the point of<lb/>
draught, viz., the attachment of the hames ; it is a difficult injury at<lb/>
times to deal with. The remedy is to plug the collar and so make it<lb/>
narrower ; all movement in the collar is to be stopped according to the<lb/>
directions previously given. Sometimes injuries occur at this part which<lb/>
appears to be well behind the collar when the latter is fitted ; in these<lb/>
cases generally very much too wide, and if pulled over towards the<lb/>
injury will be found to touch it.
</p>

<p>
Injury No. 4 is caused by a loose or a tight collar ; the whole neck for<lb/>
about five inches is very tender, and the appearance of the collar is<lb/>
indicative of the cause. The remedy is to make it narrower with strips<lb/>
of numnah, or wider by wetting it and stretching it on a block. We<lb/>
should not forget that stretching a collar shortens it.
</p>

<p>
Injury No. 5 occurs just above the shoulder joint, and is almost<lb/>
invariably due to the raw-edge of the after-wale touching the skin.<lb/>
Such collars are generally old, and the stuffing having settled down<lb/>
allows the after-wale to cut into the skin, though this may not be<lb/>
apparent until the horse is tested in draught, when it can at once be seen.<lb/>
At other times the cause of the injury can be determined by simply<lb/>
pressing the collar on to the shoulder, when the after-wale may be seen<lb/>
to touch. The remedy is either to re-stuff the collar, or, if there is no<lb/>
time for this, to cut off the edge of the after-wale close up to the lacing.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes an injury occurs in the region of No. 5, but above the
</p>

<p>
edge of the after-wale. This is due to the friction of a wide collar, and
</p>

<p>
the remedy is to deal with it as in No. 3.

putting pads beneath it to protect a sore place, because experience shows<lb/>
that the remedy is frequently worse than the disease ; a chambered<lb/>

When it is considered how necessary it is that the whole weight in ^^"^ " '<lb/>
draught should be evenly distributed over the shoulder, there can be no<lb/>
difficulty in understanding what must follow by putting one or more pads<lb/>
under the collar ; the draught comes on them entirely, and the damage<lb/>
inflicted has to be seen to be believed.

This point must not be misunderstood. It is not advised that a if collar<lb/>
horse should be worked with an altered collar when the shoulders are so be fitted,<lb/>

after the acute inflammation has subsided, it may be possible to put that<lb/>
animal to work, when the collar has been properly adjusted, without<lb/>
waiting for the complete healing of the wound.

<p>
We have spoken of shoulder injuries as if the collar were always at<lb/>
fault ; for all practical purposes it may be considered so, but there are<lb/>
cases where injury has occurred and the collar apparently fits well.<lb/>
Such will always happen when horses are soft and wanting in condition,<lb/>
and experience teaches us that as the skin hardens the tendency to gall<lb/>
is abolished.
</p>

Alteration to be accurately made. â Never allow a collar to be sent to Alteration<lb/>
the shop for alteration without the saddler seeing it on and marking the to be<lb/>
alteration required. It is astonishing how saddlers and collar makers accurately<lb/>
trust to their eye ; nothing is more fallacious. Further, they will carry "^^ ^'<lb/>
out the most elaborate work without ever thinking of trying the collar on<lb/>
to see how they are progressing, and whether the alterations are on the<lb/>
right lines. No attempt should be made at finally completing the<lb/>
alteration until the collar has been seen on ; it should be fitted in the<lb/>
unfinished state.

ANIMAL MANAGEMENT.

<p>
Shorten- Shortening of collars. â'Yo shorten a collar under these circumstances
</p>

<p>
ing of jg ^ great mistake, for if it is shortened to fit when the animal has very httle
</p>

<p>
collars. Q^ j^g neck, it is certain that it will be much too short for him when he has<lb/>
put up flesh again ; besides, a collar once shortened can only be length-<lb/>
ened with difficulty. Yet collars which are too long allow of considerable<lb/>
play, and play means friction. The horse losing flesh must not be<lb/>
allowed to wear a long collar, it should be artificially shortened to prevent<lb/>
damage, but it should not be cut. In the same way loss of flesh means a<lb/>
collar too wide ; to stuff a collar under these circumstances means that<lb/>
it is too tight when the horse puts up muscle, and yet a wide collar is a<lb/>
source of friction and injury. Here again we must reduce the width, not<lb/>
actually by stuffing, but artificially, in a manner described below.
</p>

<p>
Apart from the reasons given against stuffing and shortening the<lb/>
collars of working horses, there is the waste of material, the loss of<lb/>
time entailed by a man having to shorten and re-stuff collars, and in a<lb/>
fortnight's time having to try and make them longer. While the collars<lb/>
are undergoing this course the horses are idle, yet the most completely<lb/>
satisfactory alteration can be carried out in a few minutes without<lb/>
interfering in the slightest degree with the collar itself, and without<lb/>
stopping the horse's work.<lb/>
How to How to reduce the width of a collar.â Th^ method is this : â To make
</p>

<p>
reduce the a collar narrower, mark the region with chalk, and observe how much<lb/>
width of ^QQ wide the collar is ; a strip of numnah is cut the desired length and<lb/>
the edges shaved off ; three or more leather thongs are put through the<lb/>
edge of it, and the whole tied round the body of the collar, the hames<lb/>
passing over the thongs keep the numnah in its place. If the collar is<lb/>
still too wide another strip of numnah is put in at the desired place with<lb/>
the edges shaved off, and this is repeated until the desired amount has<lb/>
been introduced to stop all lateral movement. Some saddlers like to<lb/>
stitch the numnah strips in, or to use straps and buckles instead of<lb/>
leather thongs ; it is quite unnecessary, though perhaps neater in<lb/>
appearance.
</p>

<p>
If a collar is too deep it can be altered in the same way by raising<lb/>
it on the shoulders to the desired height, and strips of numnah<lb/>
inserted â ^just below where the collar opens â until it is retained at its<lb/>
proper height on the shoulders. These numnah strips are, of course,<lb/>
put in on both sides, and so arranged as not to interfere with the<lb/>
neck.
</p>

<p>
Such is the simple, expeditious, and absolutely satisfactory way of<lb/>
altering a collar when horses are performing hard work. By adopting<lb/>
these measures horses may be kept at duty which would otherwise

<p>
have to be thrown out of work. It may be spoken of as the " false<lb/>
collar" process.
</p>

<p>
The alterations which we have next to speak about are permanent<lb/>
ones, such as arise in the fitting of collars for the first time.
</p>

<p>
Plugging collars. â The body of a collar is filled with straw â Plugging<lb/>
preferably rye straw. This is introduced into the leather receptacle by collars,<lb/>
means of a piece of iron known as a collar-fork or collar-iron ; piece by piece<lb/>
the straw is wetted and forced into the body of the collar, until the<lb/>
required amount has been inserted. This process is termed "plugging,"<lb/>
and we have nothing more to say about it than that it is to be reserved<lb/>
for collars on first being fitted, and subsequently in course of months,<lb/>
should the body of the collar wear thin. It is a permanent process and<lb/>
should never be adopted when horses are in hard work and losing<lb/>
condition, as it entails too great a call on the saddler's time, is not so<lb/>
satisfactory as the numnah strip, and the whole of the extra stuffing has<lb/>
to be removed when the horse regains flesh. In fitting a new collar<lb/>
the place should always be marked where the extra stuffing is to be<lb/>
placed, and before the collar is finished off it should be again tried on<lb/>
the horse to see that it is perfectly satisfactory. We must bear in mind<lb/>
that a collar can only hold a certain amount of straw, and that when<lb/>
considerable additions have to be made to the stuffing, the part must be<lb/>
re-lined to admit ot it.
</p>

<p>
In shortening a collar, a certain amount on either side where it opens<lb/>
is cut off. Collars should never be shortened for horses out of<lb/>
condition ; it is not only a waste of labour, but waste of material^<lb/>
Collars can only be re-lengthened after shortening at the cost of much<lb/>
time and trouble.
</p>

<p>
Where the strain conies on collars. â The greatest wear and tear on a Where<lb/>
collar is in the throat, which not uncommonly breaks, and the collar the strain-<lb/>
when opened and tested will twist in almost any direction. Saddlers ^on^es on<lb/>
look upon this breaking at the throat as a very serious matter, but if the ^Â°'^^'"s-<lb/>
leather work is sound the part can be repaired. A collar gone in the<lb/>
throat is generally an indication of age, and, therefore, possesses other<lb/>
sources of weakness, but it may also occur from bad usage.
</p>

<p>
Breast Collars.
</p>

<p>
The simplest form of collar which can be worn is that which passes<lb/>
around the shoulders, and is known as a breast collar or breast harness.<lb/>
The term breast is not correct, as the shoulders, and not the breast,<lb/>

<p>
are the points from which the work is done, but the term is a convenient<lb/>
one and in general use.
</p>

<p>
We have pointed out that the ordinary neck collar oscillates during<lb/>
progression from side to side ; the breast collar does not oscillate, but<lb/>
has a sawing action. Sawing is obviously a greater source of friction<lb/>
than oscillation, and in consequence the make and fit of breast collars<lb/>
must be such as to present a perfectly smooth surface next the horse's<lb/>
skin. Neglect of this precaution is soon evident, even a projecting<lb/>
stitch is capable of doing great harm.
</p>

<p>
A well-made breast collar is wide, the lining being wider than the<lb/>
leather work on which the draught comes. Further, the lining must<lb/>
be as one whole piece without seam or stitch, and this is effected by<lb/>
taking a piece of soft leather and folding it ; the inside fold goes next<lb/>
the skin, while the outside one is used for the purpose of the attachment<lb/>
of the breast piece proper, \vhich is a thick piece of leather provided<lb/>
with buckles, dees, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
Such a collar is supported on the neck by a strap, frequently lined<lb/>
with felt, but in spite of this galls on the neck are frequent, owing to the<lb/>
friction to which the part is exposed. This strap works up and down,<lb/>
and either requires a metal or leather shield on the neck to move<lb/>
over, by which means all friction is avoided. The metal shield used<lb/>
by wheel horses of artillery is perfect for this purpose.
</p>

<p>
In most varieties of breast harness the pole chains pass directly<lb/>
through a link on the -collar, and the length of the pole chains must<lb/>
be such that the horses can get into their collars fairly and squarely ;<lb/>
in other words the pole chains must not be too short. At the same<lb/>
time they must not be so long that the pole is unacted upon when the<lb/>
animals hang back on the breeching.
</p>

<p>
Breast collars, pole chains, supporting straps, &amp;:c., are by no means<lb/>
easy things to fit, especially in a general service wagon, Avhere pole<lb/>
chains have to be employed.
</p>

<p>
The artillery wheel horse has two straps passing over the metal<lb/>
shield on his neck, viz., one for supporting the pole, no pole chains<lb/>
being used, and the other for supporting the breast harness.
</p>

<p>
The fittiiig of the latter strap in all patterns of breast harness<lb/>
requires great attention, owing to the friction it produces ; it must<lb/>
neither be too long nor too short. If too short the strain in draught<lb/>
comes on the neck, if too long the draught place falls below the point of<lb/>
the shoulder. Especially does this question of short supporting strap<lb/>
require the most careful and continuous attention in mule transport.<lb/>
With this class of animals even the trace supporting strap, which passes

over the back, is frequently so short that the strain of draught comes<lb/>
on to the back, while nothing is so common as the breast harness<lb/>
supporting strap being so tight that the strain of draught comes on<lb/>
the neck !
</p>

<p>
Chafes and injuries from breast harness are frequent. With badly- Breast<lb/>
made, narrow, hard, breast collars, lined or unlined, the friction resulting harness<lb/>
from the sawing motion is capable of inflicting great damage. With the ^"J^"^^.<lb/>
present artillery pattern of collars with its large lining of soft leather,<lb/>
there is no trouble whatever.
</p>

<p>
To work a horse injured by the ordinary breast harness, the only<lb/>
measure at one's service is to raise or lower the collar so as to get it off<lb/>
the injured spot, but the disadvantage of this proceeding has been dealt<lb/>
with above.

CHAPTER Vril.
</p>

<p>
THE FOOT AND SHOEING.
</p>

<p>
Natural<lb/>
wear and<lb/>
tear of<lb/>
hoof.
</p>

<p>
In a state of nature the hoof is sufficiently hard, and grows with<lb/>
rapidity enough to withstand the wear caused by the animal's weight<lb/>
when travelling over natural country. The shape of the hoof and quality<lb/>
of its horn differs according to climate and soil, and in hot countries,<lb/>
where it becomes hard and dry, animals may be worked to a considerable<lb/>
extent, without shoes. On roads, however, the natural growth of the<lb/>
hoof is not sufficiently hard, or rapid, to keep pace with the extra wear<lb/>
entailed by carrying or drawing a load, and to prevent them getting foot-<lb/>
sore, it is necessary to shoe working horses with some substance harder<lb/>
than horn.
</p>

<p>
A rim of iron has been found the best for the purpose up to date,<lb/>
and our object when attaching it to the hoof, is to cause as little damage<lb/>
to the natural structure as possible, and yet secure it firmly. This<lb/>
chapter will deal with the structures of the foot and their natural functions ;<lb/>
will discuss shoes, and nails ; will point out how our purpose may be. best<lb/>
effected, and show what errors to avoid.
</p>

<p>
The Structure of the Foot.
</p>

<p>
The bo7tes. â Buried in the centre of the foot and surrounded by the<lb/>
soft, sensitive structures which produce the horn of the hoof, are the<lb/>
small bones which form the last joint of the leg. They are the "coffin"<lb/>
(pedal) bone, and the navicular bone ; and with the lower extremity of<lb/>
the short pastern (coronet) bone, which reaches below the level of the<lb/>
coronet, they form the foot (pedal) joint.
</p>

<p>
The coffin bon e may be described as a pyramid, the back of which has<lb/>
been hollowed out, and the ground surface slightly arched. It is a<lb/>
remarkably porous looking bone, an appearance due to the large number<lb/>
of blood-vessels with which it is provided, each of which is accommodated<lb/>
in one of the minute holes covering its surface. Its actual position in the

manner with the horny leaves, which are found arranged in a similar<lb/>
manner around the inner surface of the wall, and form the chief bond of<lb/>

THE FOOT AND SHOEING. 219
</p>

<p>
The hoof. â Horn, wherever it grows, is the same in structure, and Structure<lb/>
consists of a hard, tough, gluey substance, in which is embejided a number Â°^ horn,<lb/>
of hair-like tubes. It may differ considerably in consistence, some<lb/>
varieties being almost as hard as a brick ; and others as elastic as india-<lb/>
rubber ; a difference largely due to the amount of moisture which the<lb/>
individual specimen contains. This moisture is contained in the tubes ;<lb/>
all horn has a certain quantity in its composition, and its presence<lb/>
produces that toughness which always characterises a healthy growth.<lb/>
The horn of the hoof, whether originating from the coronary band, fleshy Gro^yth of<lb/>
sole or fleshy frog, grows in the same direction, namely, sloping down- hoof,<lb/>
wards and forwards, at the same angle that the toe makes with the<lb/>
ground.
</p>

<p>
The wall is that part of the hoof which is visible when the foot is on The wall,<lb/>
the ground (fig. 45). At the extremity of the heels it bends sharply back,<lb/>
and runs forwards for a short distance, this recurved portion being called<lb/>
the "bar." The upper edge of the wall, at the coronet, is thin and soft ;<lb/>
and its inner side is hollowed into a groove which accommodates the<lb/>
coronary band. Below this groove the wall is uniformly thick from top to<lb/>
bottom at any given point, whether toe, quarter (side of hoof), or heel be<lb/>
examined. From the toe, however, the horn gets gradually thinner towards<lb/>
the quarters and heels, but where it turns round to form the bars, it again<lb/>
suddenly thickens and then gradually thins off to nothing as it runs<lb/>
forward. (Fig. 45.) The inner side of the wall, including the " bar," is<lb/>
lined by a number of horny leaves, corresponding in arrangement with<lb/>
the fleshy leaves which cover the coffin bone, and dovetailing with them.<lb/>
The outside horn of the wall is extremely hard, but it gets softer and<lb/>
lighter in colour as the leaves are approached, and on the ground surface<lb/>
of the foot, the relative position of these, i.e., the junction of the wall and<lb/>
sole, is marked by a distinct "white line." Around the upper edge of the<lb/>
wall is a thin, rough-looking band which runs all round the hoof to join<lb/>
the horn of the frog ; it is sometimes called the " coronary frog band,"<lb/>
and is very prominent and white when the foot has been soaked in water.
</p>

<p>
The wall grows from the coronary band ; each of the minute fleshy<lb/>
fingers previously mentioned, being the starting point of one of the tubes<lb/>
and the surrounding horn substance w^hich binds them together.
</p>

<p>
If untouched, being neither worn nor cut, the horn of the wall will<lb/>
grow on indefinitely, and the rate of growth at the toe being greater than<lb/>
at the heels, it will soon become disproportionately long and may then be<lb/>
a cause of stumbling.
</p>

<p>
The sole conforms in shape to the under surface of the pedal bone, its The sole,<lb/>
outer edge resting on the ground, from which it is slightly arched towards

united, but a prolonged soaking of the dead hoof will cause complete<lb/>
separation at the " white line," which is then clearly seen to be a con-<lb/>
tinuation downwards of the horny leaves. The horny sole grows from<lb/>
the fleshy sole, its fibres slanting in the same direction as those of the<lb/>
wally but unlike the latter, on attaining a definite length varying from a<lb/>
quarter to about three-quarters of an inch, they separate from the parts<lb/>
above, and shell out of the hoof. This natural provision prevents over-<lb/>
growth of the sole, which therefore requires little attention from the<lb/>
farrier. The horn of this part is softer than the wall, but harder than<lb/>
the frog.
</p>

<p>
The f7'0g is a thick, wedge-shaped piece of horn, fitted point foremost The frog.<lb/>
into the space between the angles of the heels. Its centre is the seat of a<lb/>
marked depression, the " cleft," the depth of which, in the shod hoof, is<lb/>
often exaggerated into a deep crack. The horny frog grows from the<lb/>
fleshy frog above it ; like the wall its fibres are continuous, and do not<lb/>
shell out as do those of the sole. Its consistency should be that of firm<lb/>
indiarubber, tough, and very elastic.

The Functions of the Parts.
</p>

<p>
The bones^ as in other structures, give solidity, and form an internal The<lb/>
scaffolding on which the soft parts can be securely based. bones.
</p>

<p>
The cartilages^ extending as they do beyond the wings of the pedal The<lb/>
bone and curving round the back of the foot, are evidently designed cartilages,<lb/>
to contain and support the elastic cushion of the heels ; and, while<lb/>
they are sufficiently rigid to prevent undue bulging of the parts, they<lb/>
are springy enough to yield to changes of form when under pressure<lb/>
from the weight of the horse, and return to their original position when<lb/>
this is removed.
</p>

<p>
The te?tdo?is, acting as ropes on which the muscles above pull, alter The<lb/>
the position of the bones, for the different movements required. The tendons.<lb/>
one in front (the extensor) straightens the column of bones, and<lb/>
slightly turns up the toe, for forward movement : those at the back<lb/>
(flexors) bend the bones on each other, to allow the leg to be raised.
</p>

<p>
The blood supply is so bountiful, that in addition to giving nourish- The blood.<lb/>
ment to the foot, it acts like a water bed, helping to equalise the<lb/>
tremendous pressures to which the whole structure is constantly sub-<lb/>
jected, and keeping the bones and sensitive parts contained in the hoof<lb/>
buoyantly supported, like a big ship in a little dock.

THE FOOT AND SHOEING. 223
</p>

<p>
The frog. â The whole surface of the frog being naturally in contact The frog,<lb/>
with the ground, helps to sustain the animal's weight ; but its main<lb/>
functions are to give a firm non-slipping foot-hold, and save the leg from<lb/>
the effects of the tremendous shock, jar, and concussion which half a ton<lb/>
weight of horse travelling at anything up to twenty miles an hour must<lb/>
produce, every time the hoof comes to the ground. Its consistency, that<lb/>
of indiarubber, is perfectly adapted to obviate slipping and also to minimise<lb/>
concussion, and in this last duty it is but one part of the beautiful<lb/>
natural machinery provided for the purpose and which deserves special<lb/>
consideration.
</p>

<p>
The effects of concussion are minimised as follows : â When the leg The effects<lb/>
is extended for a step forward, at whatever pace, the toe is slightly ^^^R""<lb/>
turned up and the heel comes to the ground first. The weight of the ^i^Tm^sed<lb/>
body then passes over the foot, and as it does so, the pastern is bent i^y<lb/>
downwards and backwards, the cannon, knee and arm are kept straight, shoulder,<lb/>
and the angles made by the shoulder bones vary as the weight passes, pastern,<lb/>
The elastic angles made by the pastern and shoulder at each end of the<lb/>
limb greatly lessen the shock, as compared with that which would be<lb/>
sustained by a rigid, upright column, and they are greatly assisted by the<lb/>
structure of the back of the foot. Here, as previously stated, there is<lb/>
no bony foundation, but two springy cartilages, a thick cushion of cushion of<lb/>
elastic material between them, and an indiarubber-like frog beneath ; heels, frog,<lb/>
and this is the part which first makes contact with the ground at<lb/>
each stride. The frog is squashed downwards and forwards giving a firm<lb/>
hold, and both it and the cushion above bulge out a little as the weight is and<lb/>
imposed, and aided by the cartilages regain their shape when it is cartilages,<lb/>
removed. The whole mechanism acts like a non-skidding, pneumatic<lb/>
tyre to the body, excepting that it does not wear out from constant<lb/>
use. In actual shoeing it is not always practicable to get the frog<lb/>
absolutely on the ground when the shoe is new ; depending of course<lb/>
on the thickness of the web ; but the sooner this can be brought about<lb/>
the better.
</p>

<p>
The movements of the hoofs when the foot comes to the ground, and jJ^gntT of^~<lb/>
the weight of the body passes over it, are very slight ; and for the ^.j^g hoofs,<lb/>
practical purpose of shoeing, may be disregarded. There is a slight<lb/>
bulging round the coronet, where the horn is thin and soft, and a little<lb/>
widening of the heels. This latter may be readily appreciated by looking at<lb/>
a well-worn shoe, when a bright spot will be observed from the constant<lb/>
rubbing to and fro at this place. It is not, however, a movement which<lb/>
has to be allowed for in shoeing, as it does not extend as far forward as<lb/>
the heel nails.

<p>
Make ajid shape of feet.â "Looktd at from the front, normal forefeet<lb/>
are rounded at the toe, which makes a slope of about 50 degrees with<lb/>
the ground ; the inside is rather more upright than this, and the outside<lb/>
rather less so. When the ground surface is viewed, the outer edge<lb/>
makes a rather bolder curve than the inner, the heels are wide and the<lb/>
frog big and full, with its point perhaps slightly turned to one side from<lb/>
hard thrusting on the ground. Both feet are alike in size and shape, any<lb/>
deviation being rare, except as an index of disease. The hind feet are<lb/>
not so round as the fore, they are more pointed at the toe, which is also<lb/>
more upright, and they are narrower all over. On true made legs the<lb/>
feet are placed quite straight and square when the animal is standing<lb/>
naturally.C A hind foot is often rested, but a fore one never, except when<lb/>
painful ; it is then stuck out in Â£taat of the other to relieve it of the body<lb/>
weight (pointing).^
</p>

<p>
" Flat " feet are large in circumference, very sloping, with, as a rule,<lb/>
low heels, flat soles which are sometimes thin, and a large, prominent<lb/>
frog which alone saves them from rapid destruction. When such feet are<lb/>
marked by " ridges " or " rings " of horn from unequal growth they are<lb/>
sometimes called "oyster" feet.
</p>

<p>
" Mule," " boxy," " narrow," or " club " feet are the opposite of '* flat,"<lb/>
and are characterised by smallness, uprightness of the wall, high heels<lb/>
and little frogs.
</p>

<p>
" Long," " fleshy " feet are those in which the toe is unduly long and<lb/>
cannot be reduced to normal proportions without risk of injury
</p>

<p>
" Weak heels " are those in which the rate of horn growth is very<lb/>
slow ; a formation often found in flat feet.
</p>

<p>
The thickness and rate of growth of horn varies within the widest<lb/>
limits, in different animals. Some walls grow so rapidly that a consider-<lb/>
able amount must be removed punctually every month, others scarcely<lb/>
require touching. As the horn grows forwards at the same slope as the<lb/>
toe, this part usually gets unduly long sooner than the heels, but in<lb/>
exceptional cases the latter may show a quicker growth. The thickness<lb/>
of soles may vary considerably, some being like a board and others<lb/>
so thin that pressure with the thumb will "spring" them.
</p>

<p>
The Preparation of the Foot.
</p>

<p>
Farrier's Farrier's tools are classified as " shoeing tools," for preparing the foot
</p>

THE FOOT AND SHOEING. 22$
</p>

<p>
Shoeing tools. â The shoeing hammer^ for driving nails and twisting off Shoeing<lb/>
their points when driven through the hoof, has a very strong, curved ^Z^^^-"<lb/>
claw for this purpose. The make of this claw is of importance ; it must ^^(rejna-<lb/>
be able to grip and easily twist off the point of the nail, which may, by a hammer,<lb/>
sudden movement of the horse, wound the smith's leg unless bent over<lb/>
or removed.
</p>

<p>
The Buffer^ made of steel about 5 and a half inches long, has a blunt The<lb/>
chisel at one end for cutting " clenches," and a point at the other for buffer,<lb/>
punching out " stubs," or broken nails.
</p>

<p>
The Rasp, three-quarter coarse cut and quarter file cut, should be The rasp,<lb/>
sixteen inches long and of the best quality. Shorter rasps add to the<lb/>
man's work and a level surface for the shoe is not so easily obtained by<lb/>
their use. With a good rasp the smith can do nearly everything<lb/>
required in the preparation of the foot for shoeing.
</p>

<p>
The drawing knife has a curved blade with a bent-over end. It was The<lb/>
designed to pare out the sole when that was considered a correct method, drawing<lb/>
but its use is now limited to cutting off rags of horn and taking out knife,<lb/>
small pieces of wall for the clips. Beyond this, in regularly shod feet it is<lb/>
rarely necessary.
</p>

<p>
Pincers, with wide opening, sharp jaws are used for levering off the Pincers,<lb/>
shoe, drawing nails and to assist in clenching up.
</p>

<p>
Overgroiun feet, such as may be found in batches of horses Over-<lb/>
running unshod for long periods on soft soil, are lowered by special grown<lb/>
hoof cutting pincers or a toeing knife. These are not required in *^^'-<lb/>
regimental forges, but are most useful in hospitals, remount depots and<lb/>
on service.
</p>

<p>
The preparation of the foot for shoeing. â Presuming that the hoof is The<lb/>
of normal proportions and regularly shod, the shoe is removed and as PJ^P^j^^"<lb/>
much horn as has grown since the last shoeing is rasped off; the f^Â°" jÂ° j. ^^<lb/>
comparative length of toe and heel being accurately preserved and the shoeing,<lb/>
bearing surface for the reception of the new shoe kept quite level. Any<lb/>
flakes of horn which are evidently just coming away from the sole<lb/>
may be pulled out, and any markedly ragged pieces of frog cut off,<lb/>
but no paring of the sole, or slicing of the frog, is permissible.<lb/>
Properly prepared in this way, the frog of the unshod foot will be well<lb/>
below the level of the sole, and when a shoe of moderate thickness is<lb/>
fitted, will be in contact with, or very nearly in contact with, the ground.<lb/>
Whether the frog of the newly shod foot actually touches the ground<lb/>
or not naturally depends on the thickness of the shoe and in many<lb/>
cases it is not possible to obtain this desideratum, till the shoe is part<lb/>
worn.

<p>
Faults of Faults of preparation : â
</p>

<p>
prepara- (j) Overlowering of the wall. Skill and experience are the only
</p>

<p>
^*^"' safeguards against this, and, as in other details, the smith has to
</p>

<p>
trust his eye and hand. It is not a usual error with skilful<lb/>
workmen, and as a rule only occurs the first time a newly-joined<lb/>
horse is shod, after which the man knows how much can be<lb/>
safely removed. Flat, spreading feet are most likely to suffer in<lb/>
this way.
</p>

<p>
(2) Uneven bearing surface, from overlowering one side as compared
</p>

<p>
with the other. A fault only found among learners or due to<lb/>
carelessness.
</p>

<p>
(3) "Stumping up" or " dumping" the toe. This is a serious fault.
</p>

<p>
If the toe requires shortening, it should be done by rasping the<lb/>
ground surface and not the front of the wall. If the latter is<lb/>
practised, it narrows the bearing surface of the foot and by<lb/>
rasping away the hard, outer horn, exposes the softer, moister<lb/>
layers beneath, which then become brittle. When an attempt<lb/>
is subsequently made to drive nails into the brittle horn, this<lb/>
splits and breaks off, so that the shoe may be lost. Dumping is<lb/>
very occasionally necessary with flat feet in order to get the<lb/>
nails high enough up the wall to give a secure hold.
</p>

<p>
(4) Paring the sole. This Avas formerly considered a correct
</p>

<p>
procedure. The horn was carefully pared until it "sprung"<lb/>
under the pressure of the farrier's thumb. The naturally thick,<lb/>
protective sole was thought to be detrimental to the elasticity of<lb/>
the foot and was therefore pared until it yielded on pressure.<lb/>
The soft horn of the pared sole rapidly became brittle and dry,<lb/>
just like that of the dumped toe ; and a mixture of clay and cow<lb/>
dung was then plastered into it at night, to keep the foot "cool."<lb/>
A continuance of the two last practices resulted in the horn<lb/>
becoming so brittle that a run at grass or standing in clay was<lb/>
sometimes necessary to make further shoeing possible. The<lb/>
practice is now, as far as the army is concerned, altogether<lb/>
discarded, and with the best results.
</p>

<p>
(5) Paring the frog is another relic of the past, now prohibited.
</p>

<p>
The frog was, for some reason, regarded as a delicate organ<lb/>
which would be injured from contact with the ground, and had<lb/>
to be saved by removal. The result was, as in the last two<lb/>
operations, disastrous, and resulted in shrivelled, thrushy frogs<lb/>
which gave no assistance in distributing concussion, and were<lb/>
themselves liable to bruise from any unevenness of the road.

THE FOOT AND SHOEING. 227
</p>

<p>
(6) Opening the heels is another term for cutting away the bars, in<lb/>
order to make the heels look wider. It weakens the heels,<lb/>
ultimately causes them to contract, and is rightly prohibited.
</p>

<p>
The above described errors in preparation still flourish in some Effects of<lb/>
quarters outside the army, and may often be observed in newly -joined faults in<lb/>
horses. There is no doubt that to the unthinking observer a neatly P^epara-<lb/>
dumped foot with a smoothly pared sole, opened-out heels, and symmet- ^^Â°""<lb/>
rically trimmed frog, has a more attractive appearance than the natural,<lb/>
strong, somewhat rough-looking hoof, with its flaky-looking sole and<lb/>
rather ragged, prominent frog, and for this reason such practices flourish.<lb/>
The insidious nature of these evils also aids in their continuance, for so<lb/>
strong is the hoof that it is only after a year or two of persistent abuse<lb/>
that their effects are apparent. Then, however, the dry brittle wall, into<lb/>
which nails can be driven with the greatest difficulty, the high-arched,<lb/>
easily-bruised sole, the thrushy, shrivelled frog, the narrowed heels, and<lb/>
pottering gait, tell their own tale, and end by shortening the animal's<lb/>
useful life. It is worthy of note in this connection, that all unnecessary<lb/>
cutting and paring of the hoof increases the smith's difficulties, and only<lb/>
the most skilful workman can shoe persistently ill-treated feet with any<lb/>
success.
</p>

<p>
In speaking of the structure of horn, it was noted that the moisture Rasping<lb/>
contained in the tubes gave it the quality of toughness. This moisture is ^^^ '^va.W.<lb/>
most abundant in the young, soft horn, and becomes less and less in the<lb/>
outer and older portions. Rasping the outside of the wall, paring the sole,<lb/>
and cutting the frog, permits its escape and produces brittleness ; these<lb/>
operations should therefore be confined to the narrowest possible limits.
</p>

<p>
Shoes.
</p>

<p>
A detailed explanation is here given of the various terms used in Explana-<lb/>
connection with the different parts of shoes generally, and reasons for and tion of<lb/>
against their adoption are also stated where necessary. terms
</p>

<p>
The whole of the substance of the shoe is called the " wed;' and the "^^Â°-<lb/>
width of the web, ^' cover,'' e.g., a wide-webbed shoe, is frequently spoken<lb/>
of as having "plenty of cover." From the toe to the heel on each side is<lb/>
a 'â ^branch." The terms "/^^" and "" heel" sufficiently explain themselves,<lb/>
and the '''"quarter" is that part between them on each side. The surface<lb/>
which is in contact with the foot is the " beari7ig " or " foot surface," and<lb/>
it may be either flat or " seated."
</p>

<p>
Seating is the hollowing out of the bearing surface, opposed to the Seating,<lb/>
sole, so that a seated shoe bears on the wall alone (fig. 46). A "-saucer"<lb/>

of the healthy foot is slightly arched, except at its outer edge, it is not<lb/>
requisite in the great majority of cases. In practically all heavy draught<lb/>
horses, however, seating of the fore shoes is the rule, presumably in order<lb/>
to legislate for all classes of feet by one pattern of shoe. A seated foot<lb/>
surface cannot offer as solid and extensive bearing as a flat one, and for<lb/>
army purposes should be avoided. Dirt gathers between sole and shoe,<lb/>
and in deep ground it is more likely to be sucked off.

Fullering<lb/>

</p>

<p>
As a rule, the heels of seated shoes are left flat, no alteration being<lb/>
required in this situation.
</p>

<p>
Fullering is a groove on the ground surface of the shoe in which the<lb/>
nail holes are placed. Nail holes which are not in a fullering, but are<lb/>
pierced through the whole thickness of the web, are called " stamped" A<lb/>
double fullering may be seen on some patterns, the second groove lying<lb/>
towards the inner edge of the web, and not containing any nail holes ;<lb/>
this pattern is known as a " Rodway " shoe. The arguments which have<lb/>
been advanced in favour of fullering are : â (i) that by breaking the broad,<lb/>
smooth surface of the web into two narrow edges it gives a better foothold<lb/>
and so prevents slipping ; (2) that it can be made the exact shape of a<lb/>
section of the nail used, thus ensuring perfect fitting of the latter, and further,

that the farrier can see whether the nail is accurately fitted or not ; (3)<lb/>
that it makes the shoe lighter.
</p>

<p>
That two narrow surfaces will, under certain conditions, give a better Fullered<lb/>
foothold than a broad, smooth one is, no doubt, correct, but they will wear and plain<lb/>
out quicker and the other advantages claimed will not stand examination, shoes<lb/>
A nail supported on two sides by a fullering cannot be so secure as one ^^'"P^^^<lb/>
supported on all sides in an accurately " stamped" hole. It certainly<lb/>
cannot make the shoe lighter than it otherwise would be, for no metal is<lb/>
removed in its making. There is one distinct drawback to fullering froni<lb/>
a workman's point of view, viz., that to accurately correspond with a nail<lb/>
head it must be deep and narrow. In altering machine-made shoes, this
</p>

<p>
Fig. 47.<lb/>

</p>

<p>
deep groove easily gets closed in at the top, and unless the man is specially<lb/>
careful to re-open it subsequently, the nail head cannot be driven home, Rising<lb/>
the neck no longer fits all the way down, and when the shoe is part worn clenches,<lb/>
the nail head becomes loose and the clench " rises." If a farrier makes<lb/>
a fullering, he makes it wide and shallow, so that the broken surface for<lb/>
increased foothold is obtained, and the danger of nails not being driven<lb/>
home avoided. A reason why all heavy machine-made shoes are fullered<lb/>
is, that the manufacturers find it impracticable to stamp nail holes by<lb/>
machinery through metal over a certain thickness, and it is therefore<lb/>
unavoidable in such shoes. Fullering may extend all round from heel<lb/>
to heel, or be confined to the region of the nail holes, leaving the toe<lb/>
and heel " plain."

<p>
Calkms. â With the object of giving a better foothold to heavy horses<lb/>
with a load behind them, calkins are usually made on the outer or both<lb/>
heels of the hind shoes. A calkin is produced by turning down the heel<lb/>
at right angles, and the projection being forced into the ground by the<lb/>
animal's weight, gives a good grip. When calkins are fitted to the outer<lb/>
heel of the shoe only, the inner heel is narrowed and thickened (wedge<lb/>
heel), so that it brings them level, and with the same object the toes of<lb/>
calkined shoes are similarly thickened. The object of using a " wedge<lb/>
heel " on the inner branch is to lessen the chance of " brushing."
</p>

<p>
Plain shoes are those in which the ground surface is flat.
</p>

<p>
Fig. 48.<lb/>
Shoe with calkin and thick toe.
</p>

<p>
Concave shoes have the inside of the web hollowed out, so that the<lb/>
ground surface is narrower than the foot surface.
</p>

<p>
The advantages claimed for the concave pattern are : that it is lighter<lb/>
than a plain shoe of similar thickness ; that in deep going it does not<lb/>
create so much suction, is therefore less liable to be lost, and makes lighter<lb/>
work for the horse. It is, however, obvious that it is not likely to last<lb/>
quite so long as a plain shoe of equal width throughout. The concave<lb/>
pattern is in general use for hunters, and its advantages for this particular<lb/>
type are evident.

THE FOOT AND SHOEING.
</p>

<p>
231
</p>

<p>
When the animal turns the toes out from the fetlock, the knocked-up side<lb/>
is also made deeper than the other, with the object of throwing the weight<lb/>
on the outside of the foot and so straightening the leg at the fetlock, when<lb/>
the body weight is on it.
</p>

<p>
Clips. â In order to prevent the shoe from being forced backward or<lb/>
moved from side to side, " clips " are drawn from the web, either at the Clips,<lb/>
toe or quarter, and a small piece of horn is removed from the edge of the<lb/>
wall for their reception. Usually all machine-made shoes are fitted with<lb/>
one central toe clip on front shoes, and on hind shoes with either a similar<lb/>
clip, or one on each side of the toe. For horses that kick, an outside
</p>

<p>
Fig. 49.<lb/>
Diagram to show the bearing (in section) of the concave shoe.
</p>

<p>
quarter clip is often fitted in addition to the one at the toe. It is customary<lb/>
in England to give riding horses clips at each side of the hind shoes with<lb/>
a view to avoid the chance of over-reaching, but it is doubtful if any<lb/>
advantage is gained. In any case, the clips should be as small as possible,<lb/>
with a good stout base, so that they will stand any strain likely to be<lb/>
brought on them. Many light horses can certainly do without them<lb/>
at all.
</p>

<p>
It will be noticed that although patterns of shoes are numerous, all Effect of<lb/>
variations from the plain-stamped shoe, with a flat foot surface are, with ^^'^^^ o"<lb/>
the exception of " seating," due to alterations of the ground surface. An ^f â^Q"nd<lb/>
examination of shoes which are half worn, but still on the animal, will show surface.

Nails. Nails. â The use of machine-made nails for horse-shoes is now so
</p>

<p>
universal that the hand-made variety need not be alluded to. Frost nails<lb/>
are, however, still made by hand. The size of nails is denoted by numbers<lb/>
which correspond to the number of pounds per thousand which the parti-<lb/>
cular nail weighs ; e.g.., i,ooo No. 6 are supposed to weigh six pounds. As<lb/>
a matter of fact, the actual weight is always greater than inferred by the

<p>
number. The back of the nail is flat from head to point ; on the face, the<lb/>
head, shaped like an inverted cone, slopes to the " neck," where it joins<lb/>
the " shank." The " point " is really a bevel on the face of the nail, and<lb/>
its direction helps to bring the nail out of the hoof when driven.
</p>

<p>
Good nails, which are made of the best Swedish iron, must be stiff .ind<lb/>
solid enough to drive without buckling or splitting, and yet ductile enough<lb/>
to prevent the possibility of their snapping short when the points are being<lb/>
wrung off. This last is a very serious fault, for if the shank breaks too<lb/>
short, there is not sufficient left to clench up, and the nail must be with-

drawn, and a fresh one re-driven. Their ductiHty is tested by fixing them<lb/>
in a vice and twisting them, corkscrew fashion, or bending them to and<lb/>
fro a couple of times, while their stiffness is demonstrated by supporting<lb/>
the ends, and suspending a weight from the shank.
</p>

<p>
Nails are described as " rose-headed " and " countersunk "; rose-headed Varieties<lb/>
nails are those in which the head of the nail does not enter the nail hole. Â° "^' ^'<lb/>
The pattern is no longer used in England for horse-shoes, but still survives<lb/>
in southern Europe and the East generally.
</p>

<p>
Countersunk nails are either " half" or " full " counter, the heads of the<lb/>
latter being the bigger and wider. The head of this pattern being com-<lb/>
pletely embedded in the web, gives a very firm attachment, and if the<lb/>
holes correspond actually they cannot wear loose.
</p>

<p>
The number of nails which should be used to secure the shoe is " as Number<lb/>
few as possible." Every nail cuts through a small amount of moist, tough ^"" ^}^^<lb/>
horn, which, below its tract, becomes dry and brittle. As the horn grows<lb/>
forwards, the nails of each new shoeing make fresh holes just above and<lb/>
behind the former ones, and increase the brittle area ; the fewer nails then,<lb/>
the better. The size of nails used should be proportionate to the shoe,<lb/>
and no larger than necessary, for the broader the shank, the more horn it<lb/>
cuts. For similar reasons, nails should not be driven higher than will<lb/>
give a secure hold. These rules must be given a common-sense interpre-<lb/>
tation. A horse losing a shoe on a journey is likely to do much more<lb/>
harm to his unprotected foot than would be caused by an extra nail, or a<lb/>
little high driving, and both may be necessary in particular instances, of<lb/>
which an average smith is a competent judge.
</p>

<p>
The number of nail holes in a shoe bears no particular relation to the Number of<lb/>
number of nails necessary to hold it securely. In many machine-made "^'^ holes,<lb/>
shoes a large number of holes are punched so that the best positions may<lb/>
be chosen for driving the nails.

<p>
Tke anvil has a square body, with a sharp rounded "beak." It The anvil,<lb/>
should be so heavy and solidly fixed that a strong blow on the beak will<lb/>
not move it. On the body, metal is placed for " welding" and " drawing"<lb/>
into bar ; on the beak the drawn-out bar is " turned " to shoe-shape. On<lb/>
the surface of the body are two holes, the larger for the reception of the<lb/>
shanks of the " tool " and ^-round " cutter," and the smaller for a<lb/>
" nail-cutter."

</p>

<p>
The length of handle is to let the man manipulate the metal without<lb/>
having to get too close to the fire. The farrier's shovel is called a<lb/>
" slice."
</p>

<p>
The shoe tongs are shorter in handle and jaw, the latter being of<lb/>
different widths. Those which shut close for grasping narrow bars are<lb/>
called " inside," as opposed to the wider " outside " tongs, which are for<lb/>
handling thick moulds. It is with these tongs that the smith manipulates<lb/>
all hot metal at the anvil.
</p>

<p>
The turning ham7ner or hand hammer, is used by the smith at the<lb/>
anvil. It weighs about 4 lbs., has one flat and one convex face, and the<lb/>
sides are usually somewhat angular for the purpose of drawing clips.<lb/>
With one striker to help him, the smith uses this hammer to assist in<lb/>
welding, but with two strikers, he merely beats time on the anvil, and by<lb/>
the strength of his beat, indicates the force he requires them to put into<lb/>
each blow.
</p>

<p>
The sledge, 9 lbs. weight, is used by the striker to weld the hot metal,<lb/>
draw it to the required substance, and subsequently to hammer it through<lb/>
the "swedge" or " tool"" ; to drive the stamp through the web and to cut<lb/>
the heels.
</p>

<p>
The '"'' swedge ^^ ^^ crease" or ''^concave tool^' usually called the " /^^/,"<lb/>
is a mould through which the hot bar is pulled by the smith, whilst it is<lb/>
hammered by the striker, in order to give the concave shape required.
</p>

<p>
The fuller is a blunt chisel set hammer fashion in its handle and is<lb/>
hammered into the metal by the striker, as the smith draws it along.<lb/>
Fullers differ in pattern ; those made by farriers being usually blunter,<lb/>
and producing a shallower groove than the government pattern. Too<lb/>
sharp a fuller may easily cut a hot shoe in two if struck a lusty blow, and<lb/>
ruin the work, and deep narrow fullering is very liable to be accidentally<lb/>
closed during subsequent alterations.
</p>

<p>
The stamp is a punch, the point of which should be the same shape<lb/>
as the nail head. It is held in position by the smith, and struck first<lb/>
lightly and then heavily by the striker, till it penetrates the thickness of<lb/>
the web. At the toe the point of the stamp is held at an angle which<lb/>
will produce a coarser hole than is required at the heels, and the position<lb/>
varied in succeeding holes to give the necessary gradation. The terms<lb/>
" coarse " and " fine," applied to nail holes, denote their position on the<lb/>
foot surface of the shoe in relation to the width of the web. "Coarse"<lb/>
holes, i.e.^ near the inner edge, so that the nails enter a good thickness of<lb/>
horn are naturally placed at the toe, and as the wall gets thinner towards<lb/>
the heels, the holes are made " finer," z&amp;gt;., they open nearer the outer

<p>
edge of the web. The same terms are appHed in the driving of nails<lb/>
to express their comparative nearness to the fleshy leaves.
</p>

<p>
The pritchel is a long steel punch, having the end shaped like the The<lb/>
head of the nails used. The point of the pritchel should be an accurate pt'itchel.<lb/>
reproduction of the neck of the nail, and as it soon loses its shape from<lb/>
the hot metal into which it is driven the smith frequently points and<lb/>
tempers it to regain the necessary shape.
</p>

<p>
The pritchel is used to finish off the nail holes begun by the stamp.<lb/>
In doing chis, the punching of the unfinished hole is first completed and<lb/>
the shoe is then turned over and "back pritchelled," to get rid of the "Back"<lb/>
rough edges ("burr") which might strip the nails in driving. Theo- pritchel-<lb/>
retically the nail hole should be so accurately stamped and pritchelled ^'^^'<lb/>
that it is an exact counterpart of the nail head, but in practice there are<lb/>
slight differences. In "back pritchelling," the smith makes the neck of Pitch of<lb/>
the nail hole a little bigger than the neck of the nail, so that he may '^^'*^-<lb/>
" pitch " the latter in or out, when driving it (p. 222).
</p>

<p>
This is a distinct practical advantage if carefully carried out, but if<lb/>
overdone, the neck of the hole may be so enlarged that the nail becomes<lb/>
loose before the shoe is worn out. Another slight difference is that,<lb/>
although the exact shape of the nail head, the hole is made a little<lb/>
smaller, so that the nail projecting slightly from the shoe, can be driven<lb/>
hard home, thus making sure it is secure.
</p>

<p>
Forging the shoe. â Hand-made shoes are turned either from new Forging<lb/>
bar iron or " old stuff," i.e.^ worn-out shoes. Tbe latter method is the shoe,<lb/>
adopted in the army, and as the necessary work entails a lot of hammer-<lb/>
ing, the shoes so produced are of good, tough quality. It takes i^ worn<lb/>
shoes to make a new one. The smith takes a worn shoe, bends it<lb/>
double at the toe, and between its doubled branches wedges half<lb/>
another one ; so that the result is three thicknesses of metal. The<lb/>
doubled end is placed in the fire, and brought to a welding heat, then<lb/>
quickly laid on the anvil, where two or three rapid blows weld the three<lb/>
pieces into one, and at the same time produce a convenient shape for the<lb/>
tongs to grasp during subsequent operations. The lump of metal is now a<lb/>
known as a "mould." The welded end of the mould is then grasped by "mould,<lb/>
tongs and the other end thrust into the fire and brought to welding heat.<lb/>
It may here be remarked that each fresh operation at the fire is termed<lb/>
'' taking a heat," the intensity of which is judged by the smith, looking at<lb/>
the metal as it lies in the fire. At the right moment it is taken out, given<lb/>
a swing to get rid of cinders and loose flakes, and thoroughly welded into<lb/>
a rod of sufficient length to form one half the new shoe. When the smith<lb/>
has two strikers to help him, he simply beats time for them on the anvil,

Clips are "drawn" by holding the edge of the web over the edge of<lb/>

that outer rim of the sole which is naturally flat. It should follow the<lb/>
circumference of the hoof accurately throughout, and at each heel should<lb/>
be bevelled off so that the horn and iron are in line.
</p>

<p>
The usual method is to shape the shoe as accurately as possible, by
</p>

<p>
comparison with the old one during the forging, and then to bring it hot
</p>

<p>
to the foot. It is held in contact sufficiently long to sear the horn brown

of any further slight alterations of shape required, and the position of

<p>
^"^* though shoeing is imperative, and cold fitting is therefore a necessity in

<p>
the army.
</p>

<p>
With hot fitting, the workmen can see at a glance from the brown<lb/>
appearance of the burnt horn, where the web of the shoe touches the<lb/>
hoof ; and by rasping these parts down till perfect contact of the whole<lb/>
is assured, as proved by a complete brown rim, he is certain to get an<lb/>
accurate co-aptation of hoof and shoe.
</p>

<p>
With cold fitting, there is no such guide, and to get equal perfection,<lb/>
requires a nicer appreciation by the eye of the surfaces to be joined.<lb/>
For this reason alone, cold fitting is not as a rule so accurate and solid<lb/>
as when carried out hot, and the result is a greater proportion of loose or<lb/>
lost shoes from the shoe rocking, and the clenches rising.
</p>

<p>
Another reason why heat is generally used in fitting, is the ease with<lb/>
which the hot metal is altered. With light cavalry shoes this is not a

<p>
point of such practical importance as with heavy and draught shoes, but<lb/>
in any case it adds to the labour. With very heavy shoes, any but the<lb/>
most trivial alterations to the width of the heels become impracticable in<lb/>
cold metal.
</p>

<p>
Although not so accurate and satisfactory, cold fitting can never-<lb/>
theless be carried out with sufficient success to be of practical utility, and<lb/>
being a necessity in war, must be practised in peace. To get satisfactory<lb/>
results, the workmanship must be of a good standard, and the shoer a<lb/>
thoroughly well-trained man.
</p>

<p>
An objection to hot fitting on the score of injuring the hoof is not a<lb/>
practical one, as it presupposes a bad workman. If the sole is over-<lb/>
lowered or too much burnt, no doubt a grave injury may result, and the<lb/>
shoe should be no hotter and not held on the foot longer than necessary ;<lb/>
but with a skilful man no harm is done, and results justify its adoption.
</p>

<p>
Having obtained a level bearing, an accurate fit round the edge, and<lb/>
removed small pieces of horn where clips are fitted, the smith then cools<lb/>
the shoe, files it up, and it is ready for nailing on.
</p>

<p>
Faults m fitting. â Overlowerins, of the sole should not occur with an Over-<lb/>
ordinarily careful workman, a possible exception being where a horse lowering:<lb/>
with unusually thin, flat soles is being shod for the first time. of the sole.
</p>

<p>
Excessive bur?iing of horn is sometimes done from a mistaken idea Excessive<lb/>
that the procedure makes a more solid bed for the shoe. As a matter of burning<lb/>
fact, the reverse is the case, for the charred horn becomes so brittle that Â°^ "'^^'^â¢<lb/>
it crumbles away beneath the shoe, and is likely to be a cause of it<lb/>
getting loose. Occasionally this fault is practised to make rasping<lb/>
easier.
</p>

<p>
Dumping may be a fault of fitting as well as of preparation. It is Dumping,<lb/>
rigidly repressed in the army, but is constantly practised outside it.<lb/>
From a mistaken idea that the foot should be smaller and neater looking<lb/>
than nature has made it, the shoe is often made less in circumference<lb/>
than the hoof, and the latter is then rasped round the wall till the<lb/>
desired size is obtained. Its bad results have already been noted<lb/>
(p. 226).
</p>

<p>
Too wide.â The shoe should accurately follow the outline of the foot Too wide,<lb/>
and not project beyond it at any point, an error which may cause the<lb/>
horse to strike the opposite leg (brush). A little extra width is per-<lb/>
missible at the heels, when frost nails are to be fitted.
</p>

<p>
Too long a shoe, projecting beyond the heels, is distinctly faulty. Too long,<lb/>
as it increases the liability of the shoe to be torn off, if struck by the toe<lb/>
of the hind foot. The shoe should extend up to the end of the heel, and<lb/>
be bevelled off in line with the heel itself.

Too short a shoe is equally faulty, as it fails to take a bearing on the<lb/>

</p>

<p>
Nailing on ajid finis/n?ig.â Whtn the shoe is ready for nailing on,<lb/>
the man takes the foot on his lap, holding it squarely and firmly ; and<lb/>
laying the shoe accurately in position, drives one of the toe nails. He<lb/>
then readjusts the position if necessary, drives the opposite toe nail, which<lb/>
prevents any further chance movement, and drives the remaining nails in<lb/>
succession from toe to heel on each side.
</p>

<p>
Driving nails. â In driving, the smith begins with the toe nails first,<lb/>
because they serve to fix the shoe firmly in the position he intends it to<lb/>
occupy, and also, because the horn at this point is thicker than

elsewhere, and he can therefore plant the first nail with confidence. As<lb/>
the heel is approached the horn becomes thinner, and greater care is<lb/>
required to avoid injury. The point of the nail is entered in the<lb/>
neighbourhood of the white line, and it is " pitched," or sloped at such an<lb/>
angle as is calculated to bring it out high enough up the wall to give a<lb/>
secure hold. At the same time, it must not be driven so close to the<lb/>
fleshy leaves as to " prick" or "press" (bruise) them. Nails are termed<lb/>
" coarse " when driven too close to the flesh, and " fine " when they start<lb/>
very near the edge of the wall. Those which make their exit far up the<lb/>
wall are "high," and those which come out very near the ground,<lb/>
" shallow."

</p>

<p>
In judging whether the nail is being correctly driven, the man is<lb/>
guided by sound and feel. As the point is driven through the soft horn<lb/>
near the white line, towards the harder outside of the wall, the sound<lb/>
produced at each stroke alters, and practice enables him to detect any<lb/>
deviation from the normal. In addition he keeps touching the spot<lb/>
where he expects the point to issue, with a finger tip, and so gets a good<lb/>
idea as to its direction.
</p>

<p>
Nails should be driven a medium height, those at the toe a little higher<lb/>
than at the heel. If more are employed on one side than the other, the<lb/>
inside heel nail is the first to be left out, this being least necessary, and<lb/>
most difficult to drive safely.
</p>

<p>
As each nail is driven, the projecting point is seized by the claw of<lb/>
the hammer, and wrung off by a sharp twist ; or is bent flat against the<lb/>
wall to avoid the chance of its wounding the man's leg.
</p>

<p>
Clc7iching lip. â When all the points are wrung off, the heads are well Clenching<lb/>
driven home by repeated blows of the hammer and at the same time the up.<lb/>
closed jaws of the pincers are pressed firmly upwards against the broken<lb/>
ends. This turns up a small portion of the shank, the clench. Immedi-<lb/>
ately below the clench a tiny groove may, or may not, be made by the edge<lb/>
of the rasp for its reception, and it is then hammered firmly down on to the<lb/>
wall. A few strokes with the rasp smooth off any projection, and its edge Finishing,<lb/>
may be run round between shoe and hoof, to bevel the rim of the latter<lb/>
with a view to prevent it splitting. The clips are hammered lightly into<lb/>
the same line as the slope of the wall either at the conclusion or before<lb/>
clenching up.

their being so close that they bruise them, are bound to occur from time "presses."<lb/>
to time. Generally speaking, they are very infrequent accidents with<lb/>
careful workmen, and if they recur often, or in horses with good feet, may<lb/>
be regarded as evidence of inability or carelessness. It should be<lb/>
remembered, however, that animals with small feet and thin walls are<lb/>
always more liable to this accident than others.

" High " and " Shallow " driving may be regarded as faults if they are "High "<lb/>

instead of faults.

Winter Shoeing.
</p>

<p>
" Roughing " to prevent slipping in frosty weather, is accomplished by<lb/>
several methods, that adopted in the army being the insertion of '' frost<lb/>
nails."
</p>

<p>
Turning down the heels of the shoe is the common method of the<lb/>
country and is accomplished by taking off the shoes, drawing out, turning<lb/>
down and sharpening the heels, the outer one being turned across, and<lb/>
tlie inner one in the direction of the shoe. It is an effective means, but<lb/>
it necessitates removal of the shoes.
</p>

<p>
Screw cogs in the heels are a very favourite and excellent method for<lb/>
private stables, or countries where the cogs are constantly required. If,<lb/>
however, the climate only calls for their use at indefinite intervals, a blank<lb/>
of cork or other suitable material must be inserted when the cog is not<lb/>
in, to stop grit getting into the worm of the screw, and a tap must be<lb/>
carried to rime out the thread, as the edge gets burred. Moreover, if the<lb/>
shoe is half worn when the cog is first required, the neck will be too long<lb/>
for the socket, and the attachment weak.
</p>

<p>
Similar objections can be urged against other patterns which have<lb/>
round or square shanks.
</p>

<p>
Frost nails, fitted into ordinary pattern nail holes, are adopted in the<lb/>
army, and between October and March the heels of all shoes are pierced<lb/>
for their reception. The horses are, during these months, shod a little<lb/>
wider at the heels, and the holes are punched so fine that the frost nails<lb/>
can be inserted without touching the horn, or involving the removal of<lb/>
the shoe. It is not necessary to wear blanks as the hole can be cleared<lb/>
of dirt with a nail or pritchel at any period. They are issued in two<lb/>
sizes.

heavy horses, one nail would be inserted in each heel, and in the toes

<p>
when considered requisite. For this purpose the " small " nail will do, as<lb/>
the shank will, if necessary, penetrate the hoof.
</p>

<p>
It is a good plan to have: the head of the outside nail across the shoe,<lb/>
and the inside one in the same line as the shoe, so as to prevent injury to<lb/>
the opposite leg of the horse.
</p>

<p>
The success of these nails entirely depends on the accuracy with Fitting<lb/>
which they are fitted to the nail holes. The countersunk portion of the ^''Â°^^ nails,<lb/>
nail head should be completely embedded therein, only allowing the<lb/>
" chisel " head or sharp portion to remain above the shoe, otherwise an<lb/>
undue strain is caused on the neck of the nail, which breaks or wears<lb/>
loose, or bends over. Too much attention cannot be paid to this, as a<lb/>
neglect of it often leads to failure.
</p>

<p>
The shank of the nail is to be hammered tightly round the web of the<lb/>
shoe or pinched off about half an inch from the foot surface of the shoe ;<lb/>
this can be done by making a nick in the nail with the edge of the rasp ;<lb/>
a bend or two with the pincers will then break it. The part of the shank<lb/>
remaining should be firmly clenched by being hammered down.
</p>

<p>
It is not necessary to remove the nails when the horses return to<lb/>
stables, but it may be done at discretion. No special tools are needed<lb/>
for the use of these nails ; the ordinary stamp and pritchel are suitable,<lb/>
and the nails are readily removed with pincers.
</p>

<p>
Wear of Shoes.
</p>

<p>
A month is the period usually stated as the time a shoe should<lb/>
last, and this is correct as regards the time it is advisable to<lb/>
keep it on the foot, without attention. At the end of a month the horn<lb/>
has grown to an appreciable extent, and whether the shoe is worn<lb/>
out or not, it is generally advisable to take it off, and lower the foot.<lb/>
If the old shoe is still good enough to be replaced, the operation is called<lb/>
a "remove." The actual wear of shoes, however, depends, of course, on " Re-<lb/>
their original substance, the work done, and the nature of the ground i^oves.<lb/>
travelled over. A shoe which might be rightly considered too light for<lb/>
use on the macadamized roads of England, would be unnecessarily heavy,<lb/>
and wear for months in a roadless, sandy country, so that it is not<lb/>
possible to obtain one single type shoe which is perfectly suitable under<lb/>
all conditions. The actual weight of shoes generally used in England is Weight<lb/>

<p>
The weight being so considerable, as light a shoe as possible should<lb/>
be adopted under all circumstances, but it must wear long enough to<lb/>
prevent too frequent shoeing, or the wall will break from constant nailing.<lb/>
Unfortunately the two requisites in an ideal shoe, lightness and long<lb/>
wear, are opposites which it is evidently impossible to combine in iron,<lb/>
and all that can be done in practice is to keep the weight as low as the<lb/>
average amount of work will admit.
</p>

<p>
The rate of wear on macadamized roads is increased when the surface<lb/>
is wet, while road work under all circumstances wears out shoes very<lb/>
much quicker than cross country journeys.
</p>

<p>
The wear of hind shoes is greater than of fore, and the outside of the

shoe than the inside ; with rare exceptions the outside toe is the first<lb/>
place to be worn through.
</p>

<p>
Many horses wear their shoes much faster than others, the increase<lb/>
being sometimes more than twice as much. With ordinary shoes tested<lb/>
on roads, the individual difference will vary between 100 to 350 miles<lb/>
under precisely similar conditions.

<p>
Various Patterns of Shoes.
</p>

<p>
Racehorses are generally shod during their training with the lightest<lb/>
class of concave, fullered shoe, weighing about six ounces, but for the<lb/>
actual race specially light " plates " from two to four ounces are put on.
</p>

<p>
Hunters a7id Hacks. â For both these classes the concave, fullered<lb/>
pattern, either flat or with small calkins and wedge heels, is the rule, the<lb/>
toes of the hind shoes being frequently " square " to lessen the chance

of over-reaching. Hunters are sometimes shod with 'â 'â  Char Her ^^ shoes, "Charlier'<lb/>
which merit notice. Named after their inventor, they are made of shoes,<lb/>
narrow iron, which is let into the margin of the hoof. A special knife<lb/>
removes the requisite horn and this is replaced by its counterpart in iron<lb/>
(Fig. 52). The idea is admirable, but only practicable where horses<lb/>
work to a large extent on soft ground. The iron is let into the hoof, very<lb/>
near the flesh, requires very good workmanship, and on hard roads is apt<lb/>
to become further embedded in the horn, and make the horse go<lb/>
" feeling " from the pressure.
</p>

<p>
Another class of shoe frequently found on saddle horses is the " tip." Tips.<lb/>
Tips are not more than half the length of full shoes, and their

object is to bring the frog on the ground. It is an excellent method of<lb/>
doing so, but they require applying with considerable judgment or the<lb/>
extra concussion the animal experiences when the bare heel is suddenly<lb/>
brought to the ground may create further mischief.
</p>

<p>
Carnage horses are either fitted with " Rodway " pattern or ordinary<lb/>
plain shoes with calkins on the hind feet.
</p>

<p>
Draught horses of all descriptions are given plain shoes, which are,<lb/>
in the case of machine-made shoes, fullered to permit of the nail holes<lb/>
being punched through the thick web, with large calkins, and in some<lb/>
districts with " toe pieces." A toe piece is a strip of iron, welded edge<lb/>
on, across the ground surtace of the toe of the shoe, to allow the horse<lb/>
to get extra purchase when starting a heavy load.

<p>
S/ioes to obviate stumbling are of two patterns, either the toe of the<lb/>
hoof is rasped short and the shoe " turned up " (" rolled,'' " dubbed") at<lb/>
this part, or the metal of the shoe is thinned as much as possible, the<lb/>
object in each case being to shorten the toe and prevent its premature<lb/>
contact with the ground, at the moment when, the stride being completed,<lb/>
the toe is being turned up to bring the heel down. The two methods,<lb/>
Z.I?., rasping the toe short and thinning the metal of the shoe, are<lb/>
frequently combined and make the best pattern for confirmed stumblers.

<p>
British Aruiy patter?!. â Machine made, concave, plain toe, fullered<lb/>
shoe, of equal width throughout, concavity most marked towards the<lb/>
heels ; foot surface practically flat. The specification states that this<lb/>
surface shall be bevelled (seated) from the nail holes to the inner edge of the<lb/>
web, the extreme depth not to exceed one-sixteenth inch. This is so slight<lb/>
as to be scarcely noticeable in the majority of shoes supplied. Nail holes,<lb/>
three to five on each side of the toe. Clips, single on all fore, and wheelers<lb/>
hind shoes ; double toe clips for riding and lead hind shoes. Calkins on<lb/>
wheel hind shoes only ; these are small, of equal size and shape on each<lb/>
heel. Frost shoeing by frost nails as already described. Sizes from<lb/>
I to lo, weight from 8 to 45 ounces per shoe.

<p>
Frejich Army. â Hand made, plain shoes ; the fore shoes seated at the<lb/>
toe and quarter. Nail holes, three to four on each side of the toe, the toe<lb/>
holes being well up towards the clip. Single clips to all shoes. Each<lb/>
shoe is pierced with four screw holes, one in each heel, and one on each<lb/>
side of the toe between the two first nail holes. Frost shoeing and calkins<lb/>
by means of square-headed cogs which fit the screw holes just mentioned.<lb/>
Three sizes, " legere " (small), " ligne " (medium), and "reserve"<lb/>

CHAPTER IX.
</p>

<p>
TRANSPORT BY SEA AND RAIL.
</p>

<p>
The selection and fitting of ships for the transport of animals is<lb/>
carried out by the Admiralty, and the duties of military officers in this<lb/>
matter, under ordinary circumstances, are confined to inspection after<lb/>
completion, to see that the fittings are in accordance with specifications,<lb/>
that the stores are of good quality, and the ship in every way fit for<lb/>
embarkation. For this purpose a board of naval and mifitary officers<lb/>
inspects the ship prior to embarkations, and a veterinary officer accom-<lb/>
panies them.
</p>

<p>
But during war, or at remote ports, any officer may find<lb/>
himself called upon to report regarding the fitness of a ship for the<lb/>
conveyance of animals, or take command during the transport of them.<lb/>
It is therefore necessary to have an accurate general idea of requirements<lb/>
and fittings, and a close acquaintance with the details of management<lb/>
during a voyage. The importance of this knowledge being possessed by<lb/>
all officers must be insisted on. For oversea expeditions the value of<lb/>
horses landed in good condition at the base of operations is not to be<lb/>
estimated in money ; if in bad condition they are useless till they are fit ;<lb/>
if landed well they are invaluable.
</p>

<p>
4
</p>

<p>
Class of Ships Required.
</p>

<p>
The typical horse transport for troops should be of good average<lb/>
speed, roomy for the number to be carried, a steady sea boat, broad of<lb/>
beam, with big hatchways, watertight doors leading through compart-<lb/>
ments, ample mechanical ventilation, good means for drainage, lighted<lb/>
throughout by electricity, and with specially good arrangements for<lb/>
exercising.
</p>

<p>
These requirements set a high standard, but the importance of the<lb/>
animals' condition when landed for a campaign is such as to more than<lb/>
nistify all the expense incurred by their being insisted on.
</p>

<p/>

SEA TRANSPORT. 247
</p>

<p>
To ascertain roughly the 7iumber of horses which can be carried on a To<lb/>
deck, cut off all portions where there is less than 12 feet clear out from ascertain<lb/>
the ship's side, and the remaining length in yards, will give the ^^P^^i y.<lb/>
approximate number of stalls.
</p>

<p>
Speed should be good, so that the voyage may be shortened as far as Speed,<lb/>
possible ; the longer the journey, the more condition is unavoidably lost.
</p>

<p>
The increased steadiness obtained from the fitting of bilge keels is<lb/>
such an advantage, that preference should always be given to a vessel<lb/>
with them.
</p>

<p>
A bilge keel is a broad flange, projecting from the lower part of the A bilge<lb/>
hull and running the length of the ship, which helps to steady rolling by ^^^'â¢<lb/>
the increased resistance it offers to the water during this motion.
</p>

<p>
Breadth of beam is essential, as it gives room and probably indicates Breadth (<lb/>
steadiness, and a calculation of the actual size of boat required may be beam,<lb/>
made on a basis of 8-12 tons according to length of voyage (gross<lb/>
tonnage) for each horse to be embarked, e.g., a boat of 4,000 tons will, if<lb/>
otherwise suitable, carry from 320 to 500 horses.
</p>

<p>
Hatchways should be at least 10 feet square to be of any use for Hatch-<lb/>
horses, and the longer they are the better, to admit of sufficient head ways,<lb/>
room for fitting " brows."
</p>

<p>
A brow or ramp is a gangway sloping from one deck to another to A brow,<lb/>
allow horses to pass up or down. Hard wood battens are screwed<lb/>
across the floor at intervals of 9 inches to give foothold, and the sides<lb/>
are boarded up high enough to prevent horses attempting to jump<lb/>
over.
</p>

<p>
Watertight doors are those doors which, when closed, divide the Water-<lb/>
ship into watertight compartments. In some ships these doors are not tight<lb/>
fitted, the boat being built in compartments which do not communicate, doors.<lb/>
In a horse ship this would entail much extra trouble, and only<lb/>
ships with communicating watertight doors should be considered<lb/>
suitable.
</p>

<p>
Ventilation.
</p>

<p>
Too much importance cannot be attached to the provision of ample<lb/>
means for ventilation. It is at all times difficult to ventilate lower decks<lb/>
and holds which are beneath the water line, and especial care should be<lb/>
taken to provide methods both for withdrawing the foul air, and for<lb/>
pumping in a fresh supply ; this is especially necessary in the vicinity of<lb/>
stalls which are furthest removed from the neighbourhood of the<lb/>
hatchways.
</p>

248 ANIMAL MANAGEMENT.
</p>

<p>
In addition to hatchways and port holes, which should be kept<lb/>
constantly open whenever possible, the means for ventilating are :<lb/>
(i) Permanent air funnels ; (2) Iron wind scoops ; (3) Canvas wind sails ;<lb/>
(4) Electric fans or blowing machines ; (5) Steam ventilation.
</p>

<p>
(i) Pe7-manent ai?- fiuinels with large movable cowls are fitted to<lb/>
each deck, and should be arranged in pairs, one being brought down to<lb/>
within a foot of the deck and the other cut off close to the deck above,<lb/>
thus furnishing an up-take and down draught (outlet and inlet). The<lb/>
cowl of the former should be kept turned from, and of the latter to the<lb/>
wind, unless the ship is fitted with Boyle's, or other patent outlet and<lb/>
inlet cowls which do not require this attention.
</p>

<p>
(2) Iron wind scoops are provided for fitting to port holes and<lb/>
scuttles, and as they stand out at right angles to the ship's side with<lb/>
the concave surface forwards, they deflect a constant current of air<lb/>
inwards.
</p>

<p>
(3) Canvas wind sails 2.x^ long funnels with a wide bell mouth, and<lb/>
are arranged from the rigging in the same way as the permanent air<lb/>
inlets, i.e.^ mouth to the wind. They can be employed as inlets for<lb/>
fresh air only ; they should be fitted so that the opening of the funnel is<lb/>
about a foot from the surface of the deck, and their frequent inspection<lb/>
is a matter of necessity, as they are so liable to be accidentally<lb/>
blocked or collapsed, particularly when leading to the lower portions of<lb/>
the ship.
</p>

<p>
(4) Electric fans, blowing machines, or other mechanical means of<lb/>
ventilation should be lavishly fitted to all horse decks on ships employed<lb/>
for conveying animals for war purposes. By their means, if fully<lb/>
employed and judiciously distributed, currents of air can be set up, and<lb/>
a fresh atmosphere created in the dead ends of the decks, far from the<lb/>
hatchways, where ventilation on an adequate scale is otherwise<lb/>
impossible. Expense should not be the sole guide in fitting these^ as the<lb/>
extra health and fitness of the animals on landing more than compensates,<lb/>
from a military point of view, for the extra outlay. Fans and the mouths<lb/>
of blowers should be adequately protected or placed in positions where<lb/>
they cannot be touched.
</p>

<p>
(5) Steam ventilatiofi. â The system adopted by the Admiralty is<lb/>
Dr. Edmonds', and consists of one or more main ventilators, with<lb/>
movable cowls, which communicate below with horizontal air shafts<lb/>
running the length of the deck and perforated every 5 or 6 feet. To<lb/>
exhaust foul air, the cowls are turned from the wind and steam at a<lb/>
pressure of 40 lbs. is forced through a "jetter " at the base of the cowl.<lb/>
This produces a vacuum in the air shafts which causes the foul air to

</p>

<p>
be sucked through the perforations. To act as an inlet for fresh air,<lb/>
the cowl is turned to the wind, and the steam jet being discontinued,<lb/>
the apparatus becomes an ordinary i?tlet shaft. Its use for half<lb/>
an hour about every four hours is recommended. Although a<lb/>
valuable aid, this method is intermittent and is not a very efficient<lb/>
inlet ; it cannot be regarded as in any way the equal of the<lb/>
electric fan or blast. WJiatever form of mechaiiical ventilation is<lb/>
adopted it should be atnple for requirements when the hatches are<lb/>
battened dowji.
</p>

<p>
Draijiage. â This is usually unsatisfactory on a horse ship. The Drainage,<lb/>
whole drainage runs, as "a rule, from the decks, down small pipes,<lb/>
leading from the scuppers to the bilge ; the entrance to these pipes<lb/>
is guarded by a perforated cover to prevent them becoming choked<lb/>
with dung and other solids. NotAvithstanding this precaution,<lb/>
the pipes constantly become so choked and the urine has to be<lb/>
pumped up, and overboard, by hand. For this reason suitable hand<lb/>
pumps should be provided, unless a better system is adopted. There<lb/>
should be no difficulty in dealing with the drainage of decks above<lb/>
the water line ; it should run straight overboard and not into the<lb/>
bilge. In decks, however, which are below water, it is more difficult<lb/>
to dispose of, and unless the ship is specially fitted for the purpose,<lb/>
it must be got rid of as described above. The drainage of stalls<lb/>
in the hold is allowed to run into the coal beneath the flooring. All<lb/>
dung must necessarily be brought up by hand from below and thrown<lb/>
overboard.
</p>

<p>
Stalls.
</p>

<p>
Transports conveying mounted units can as a rule accommodate the<lb/>
horses on two decks only, owing to the amount of room required for<lb/>
troops ; but in ships chartered for the carriage of horses only, all the<lb/>
decks may be utilized for the erection of stalls, and the hold and alley<lb/>
ways can also be occupied if suitable.
</p>

<p>
Horses are not to be carried on topgallant forecastles or poops, nor<lb/>
are they to be stood against bulkheads or in the vicinity of steam-pipes.<lb/>
Five per cent, spare stalls and two per cent, loose-boxes (8 feet square) are<lb/>
fitted.
</p>

<p>
Arrans;e7ne7it of stalls.â AW stalls should be placed athwart the ship. Arrange-<lb/>
Down each side of the deck a long row is erected, heads inward. When ment of<lb/>
there is room enough for a row down the centre of the deck there must ^^ ^'

bumping, is also very great, and they may give way. Heavy losses have<lb/>
been incurred in the past as the result of stalls being so placed, and the<lb/>
plan is quite unfitted for a ship which may encounter any seaway. It<lb/>
may be used to advantage for river transport, and economises room.
</p>

<p>
Structure of Stalls.
</p>

<p>
The essential parts of a stall are the stanchions, cants, breast rail,<lb/>
haunch rail and side bars. Each stall is fitted with a movable platform,<lb/>
upon which the horse stands, and a manger and hay net staple are<lb/>
attached.
</p>

<p>
Stanchions^ 5 inches by 5 inches, are the corner posts of the stall and must Stan-<lb/>
be strong and firmly fixed, as on their stability the whole structure depends, chions.<lb/>
Their heels (lower ends) are secured from moving by strong cleats, by being<lb/>
mortised to the side cants, and supported by the front and rear cants.<lb/>
Their heads (upper ends) are firmly wedged between decks and are cross<lb/>
tied and bolted to fore and aft beams. On exposed decks the rear<lb/>
stanchions are clamped to the bulwark rails.
</p>

Between 3 feet and 5 feet of their height, front stanchions are covered<lb/>
Avith zinc ; on the front of them are iron brackets for the reception of the<lb/>
breast rail ; two halter rings, one above and the other below the breast<lb/>
rail ; and a staple for a hay net. The inner sides of both front and rear<lb/>
stanchions have batten grooves for side bars or parting boards.

<p>
Cants are heavy beams of hard wood (oak, 6 inches by 4 inches) Cants,<lb/>
which are bolted to the decks to form the foundation of the stall. They<lb/>
are termed front, rear or side cants according to their position, and support<lb/>

The breast rail, 10 inches by 3 inches, the upper third covered with The breast<lb/>
zinc, is fitted into iron brackets fixed on the front of the front stanchions rail,<lb/>
and is prevented from rising by a swinging stop of wood. On the zinc-<lb/>
covered portion the food trough is hung.

padded these may be. By a long stall is meant one which gives sufficient<lb/>
room from front to rear for the occupant to take a pace in either direction<lb/>
without any chance of touching the breast or haunch rails. The reason<lb/>
why such a stall answers best is obvious. A horse stands on a long narrow<lb/>
base, represented by the length from the fore to the hind feet and the

and does so by inclining his body to and fro as the ship rolls, or, should<lb/>
the roll prove unexpectedly heavy, by taking a step to front or rear and<lb/>
thereby increasing his security. A long stall permits this without<lb/>
hindrance, but in a short one he is unable to do it, or, if he attempts<lb/>
to, is bumped by breast piece and haunch rail alternately, thrown ofif his<lb/>
balance and perhaps severely bruised. Eight feet in the clear may be<lb/>
taken as the correct length of stall for a horse. At present the Admiralty<lb/>
regulations stipulate for a 6 feet stall and a passage of 2 feet between the<lb/>
haunch rail and the side of the ship ; the removal of the haunch rail and<lb/>
the lengthening of the platform on which the animal stands are the<lb/>
only changes necessary to obtain the desired measurement.
</p>

<p>
Width. â The stall should be narrow. As previously explained, the<lb/>
animal cannot balance himself sideways so well as from front to rear, and<lb/>
a narrow athwart ship stall which prevents any attempt to turn round<lb/>
keeps him facing the roll, /.&amp;lt;?., the direction of greatest movement, which is<lb/>
the best for his security ; 2 feet 4 inches in the clear is a suitable width<lb/>
for a full-sized horse.
</p>

<p>
Height. â The height of a stall should, if possible, be 8 feet over<lb/>
the horse's head and 7 feet behind, but such heights cannot as a rule<lb/>
be obtained except in upper-deck stalls. In between decks the Admiralty<lb/>
stipulate for a minimum of 7 feet from the surface of the deck planking to<lb/>
the underside of the beams above, and this should be the limit for all<lb/>
animals, as apart from the danger of striking their heads, the amount of<lb/>
space lost in low-pitched decks adds appreciably to the difficulties of<lb/>
ventilation.

<p>
Stalls ill the Jiold. â When it is found necessary to carry horses in the Stalls in<lb/>
hold, which should only be done where the ship is specially suitable and the hold,<lb/>
ample head room can be secured, the stanchions should be first fitted from<lb/>
the bottom of the ship to the deck above, coal stowed through the<lb/>
hold around them, and a wooden platform 2\ inches thick laid on top of<lb/>
the coal, in no case less than lo feet from the deck above, and more when<lb/>
possible, up to 15 feet. Foot battens to be secured to floor inside the<lb/>
stalls as on ordinary platforms. The coal takes the drainage. The ship's<lb/>
side should be Hned as in other decks, and a 12-inch bevelled board<lb/>
secured to the platform, to lean at an angle against the lining to allow for<lb/>
the settling of the coal.
</p>

<p>
Horses should not be stowed more than 15 feet before and abaft the<lb/>
hatch.
</p>

<p>
All woodwork of stalls should be well rounded and smoothed on inner All wood-<lb/>
sides. With long stalls, pads are unnecessary. work.
</p>

<p>
When stalls are carried back to the ship's side, this should be lined<lb/>
with boards so fitted that dung cannot collect between the lining and the<lb/>
side.
</p>

<p>
Platforms. â In each stall is laid a movable platform, on which the Platforms,<lb/>
horse stands ; it is made of three i^-inch deal boards set i inch<lb/>
apart and secured by battens the width of the stall.
</p>

<p>
The battens should be of hard wood (oak) and securely screwed to each<lb/>
board ; they should in an 8 feet stall be placed as follows : one near the front<lb/>
and rear of the platform, say 6 inches from the edge, and the others at<lb/>
intervals of about 21 inches. In the case of shorter stalls these intervals<lb/>
would be lessened.
</p>

<p>
Down the centre of the underside of each board and throughout its<lb/>
length is fixed a longitudinal batten which raises the platform off the deck<lb/>
for the purpose of allowing free drainage.
</p>

<p>
Mangers are fitted to hang on the zinc-covered upper edge of the Mangers,<lb/>
breast rail by two broad metal hooks. They should be constructed of<lb/>
galvanized metal with rounded edges and corners, which render them easy<lb/>
to cleanse. Wooden feed boxes are sometimes used, but should nowadays<lb/>
be replaced by metal.
</p>

<p>
Hay nets should be fastened across the front of the stall, if possible, Hay nets,<lb/>
and not dangled from a single cord at the side, a position which much<lb/>
increases the animal's difficulty in obtaining each mouthful. All hay<lb/>
should be fed from these nets, or it is largely wasted.
</p>

<p>
Water supply. â A permanent water service is fitted to all horse decks Water<lb/>
with taps in suitable positions, which may vary according to requirements, supply.<lb/>
The supply should be independent of the ship's engines and workable by

ANIMAL jVIANAGEMENT.
</p>

<p>
Arrange-<lb/>
ments for
</p>

<p>
hand in case of breakdown. The quantity allowable for each horse is ten<lb/>
gallons daily, and each ship is required to possess a distil capable of<lb/>
producing this amount ; in addition, water sufficient for two-thirds the<lb/>
estimated time of the journey is carried in iron tanks.
</p>

<p>
Arrangements for exercise. â If military horses required for war on<lb/>
landing are to be of any use when they arrive at their destination, they<lb/>
must be exercised, and provision for this should be made on all ships<lb/>
which carry mounted troops. It is not, of course, possible with unbroken<lb/>
horses and a small staff, but for fighting units which may be required the<lb/>
moment they step ashore, special arrangements should be made to allow<lb/>
them to exercise every horse every day the weather permits. For this<lb/>
purpose a portion of one deck should have a track wide enough for two<lb/>
or three abreast, laid with suitable matting, and accessible, by means of<lb/>
brows, from both or all horse decks ; should this plan not be feasible, all<lb/>
passages between stalls should be wide enough and so arranged as to<lb/>
admit of exercise round the deck when feed boxes are removed. To<lb/>
secure this some room should be sacrificed if necessary, as the military<lb/>
efficiency obtainable by this means, and not otherwise, is invaluable.<lb/>
An exposed deck is naturally the best for exercise.
</p>

<p>
Short of this ideal, every effort should be made to move each horse<lb/>
every day weather permits, if only a few yards. Constant standing with-<lb/>
out movement has such an injurious effect on the circulation of the legs<lb/>
and feet that the slightest amount of exercise is beneficial ; and the more<lb/>
the better.
</p>

<p>
Embarkation.
</p>

<p>
It is necessary to distinguish sharply between two classes of animals<lb/>
embarked for oversea service, the first comprising trained, well-conditioned,<lb/>
corn-fed troop-horses which accompany their units, and the second con-<lb/>
sisting of remounts despatched subsequently, accompanied by very small<lb/>
staffs, possibly untrained, and occasionally grass-fed till they embark. The<lb/>
conditioning of this latter class must be undertaken when they land, they<lb/>
cannot arrive fit for immediate work ; but the troop-horse may be required<lb/>
the moment he steps ashore, and therefore his condition should be main-<lb/>
tained in every way possible. The first step towards this end is that he<lb/>
should embark thoroughly fit. It is inevitable that he will lose some<lb/>
condition en route ; this cannot be prevented under the most favourable<lb/>
circumstances, but the fitter he is for general purpose work when he steps<lb/>
on board, the fitter will he land if properly taken care of. Troop-horses<lb/>
should not therefore be let down in condition before they embark ; they<lb/>
should be hard and fit; but their bowels should not be constipated, and to

</p>

<p>
ensure this their diet should be of a laxative nature for twenty-four hours<lb/>
previous to embarkation.
</p>

<p>
Just previous to embarkation they should be watered and fed with corn,<lb/>
and arrangement should be made that as soon as each is secured in the<lb/>
ship's stall, hay should be given, a procedure which helps materially to keep<lb/>
them quiet in their strange surroundings. If the embarkation is to be<lb/>
by slinging, the times of feeding should be so arranged as to prevent<lb/>
any animal being slung within two hours of watering.
</p>

<p>
Shoeing. â All troop-horses are to be recently shod before embarkation. Shoeing.<lb/>
Unshod animals land footsore, from the wearing away of the horn which<lb/>
is softened by the constant moisture on board, and they are incapable of<lb/>
work or of being shod immediately on arrival. A careful inspection of the<lb/>
shoeing should be carried out immediately before embarkation and daily<lb/>
during the voyage.
</p>

<p>
Ship's head collars should be put on before embarking. These head Ship's<lb/>
collars have a double head rope, one from each cheek piece, which are head<lb/>
fastened to the rings provided on the front stanchions. It is a good plan collars,<lb/>
to tie one to a lower ring and the other to the upper ring on the opposite<lb/>
stanchion, allowing the animals just sufficient liberty to reach the hay net<lb/>
and feed box, but not to bite each other. When first placed in a stall<lb/>
some horses will try and jump out or rear up, but are prevented if tied as<lb/>
above.
</p>

<p>
Before embarkation begi?is it should be ascertained that the way to the Before<lb/>
furthest stall is quite clear, that the side bars, or parting boards, are all embarka-<lb/>
taken down and handy for replacing, and that the brows and decks offer ^^^".^<lb/>
secure foothold. If possible, the hay nets ready filled should be on the ^^'"^â¢<lb/>
stalls.
</p>

<p>
Foothold may be secured by coir mats, ashes, or litter. Coir mats. Foothold,<lb/>
when thick and heavy enough to retain their position without moving or<lb/>
wrinkling, are excellent. Thin coir matting does well if firmly secured,<lb/>
but is not safe if loose, as it slips under the feet.
</p>

<p>
Ashes, which are always obtamable from the engines, are excellent,<lb/>
and should be made use of throughout the voyage for this purpose. Litter<lb/>
is useful for scattering at the entrance of brows, as horses are used to its<lb/>
appearance and will step on to it with confidence : it may also be used with<lb/>
advantage to make a soft bed for them to land on Avhen slung on board ;<lb/>
but it is rather slippery on decks, especially when new, and mats and<lb/>
ashes are to be preferred.
</p>

IValkijtg on board by a gangway.â A. steady and reliable horse should Walking<lb/>

<p>
he should be at once taken out of the line and kept till the others have<lb/>
embarked ; this will ensure a constant steady flow and prove quicker than<lb/>
checking the whole movement in order to deal with a few difficult animals.<lb/>
The entrance to the gangway is the spot where difficulty is usually en-<lb/>
countered, but if the leader goes quietly and the others follow without pause<lb/>
only a few will be found troublesome. The leading horse is led to the<lb/>
farthest stall, the side bar replaced, the head ropes tied, and hay given.<lb/>
Horses which habitually stand or work together should be neighbours.<lb/>
Kickers should be given end stalls and kicking boards put up. All men<lb/>
not detailed for other duties should stay with the horses till they are used<lb/>
to their new quarters.<lb/>
Methods of Methods of dealing with troublesome horses.â If the gangway is neither<lb/>
dealing ]ong nor steep, they may be backed along it instead of led ; some will lead<lb/>
when blindfolded. If these methods fail a rope may be passed round the<lb/>
quarters when the horse is near the gangway and the animal forcibly pulled<lb/>
on to it by a couple of men at each end. A crupper may be made<lb/>
for the purpose by doubling a long rope and tying a loop in the centre,<lb/>
the free ends being brought forward and pulled on at each side when the<lb/>
loop is adjusted under the tail.
</p>

<p>
Slinging on board. â The slings for this purpose have a loop of rope<lb/>
attached to each spreader, one being eyed. The eyed loop is passed<lb/>
through the other when the sling is adjusted to the body and the eye<lb/>
placed over the crane hook. To the front and back of the slings are<lb/>
attached breast and quarter ropes, which should be fastened tightly,<lb/>
particularly the one round the quarter. To the head collar is attached<lb/>
a guy (long line) for the purpose of holding the head steady as the horse<lb/>
is being hoisted and lowered ; it should be held by the man who is at the<lb/>
horse's head while the sling is adjusted, and at the moment the animal is<lb/>
swung inboard he should pass it to the ship, where it is held by the man<lb/>
who receives the horse on deck. A double guy is sometimes used, one<lb/>
line being held on shore and the other on the deck, but a single one is<lb/>
sufficient 'f the horse is properly trussed in the sling.
</p>

<p>
In slinging horses five men are required, one at the head, one at each<lb/>
side, one at the breast, and one behind. One end of the sling is passed<lb/>
under the horse's belly, and both ends are brought up to meet over his<lb/>
back ; the eyed loop is passed through the other, and is received<lb/>
by the man on the other side, who hauls it through, hooking the tackle to<lb/>
it, both men holding up the ends of the sling until it is taut. The men<lb/>
at the breast and behind bring their ropes round and make them fast to<lb/>
the grummets, and the man who holds the horse's head makes fast the<lb/>
guy to the ship's head collar, When all is ready, the word " Hoist away "

will be given, and the horse is to be rapidly run up from the ground to<lb/>
the necessary height, and then carefully lowered down to the hatchway.<lb/>
Two or three men should be stationed at the hatchway and between<lb/>
decks, to guide the horse when being lowered.
</p>

<p>
Timid or restive horses may be blindfolded.
</p>

<p>
Accidents in slinging. â The only probable accidents are : from the Accidents<lb/>
horse slipping out of the sling and falling on the quay ; or from being ^'?. .<lb/>
injured as the result of struggling on first reaching the deck. ^ ing'ng-
</p>

<p>
Slipping out of the sling may happen if the quarter rope is not<lb/>
securely and tightly fastened. Horses always slip out backwards, not<lb/>
forwards. The liability to slipping is increased if the head is not held<lb/>
steady, but if this is attended to and the animal well "trussed" in by the<lb/>
breast and quarter ropes, the operation is practically without risk.
</p>

<p>
On first reaching the deck, horses land all abroad, and as soon as they<lb/>
feel their feet make a bound forward and struggle unless they are firmly<lb/>
held by the head. A reliable man should therefore be selected for this<lb/>
post, and care should be taken to provide a good foothold and soft bed<lb/>
for the landing.
</p>

<p>
Enibarki7ig from lighters. â If the lighters can come alongside a pier, Embark-<lb/>
a gangway is used as for walking on board. On an open beach each if^ ivom<lb/>
lighter must have a ramp which lets down on the shore with suitable cross "&amp;"ters.<lb/>
battens to prevent slipping. Sand or shingle is used to bed the end of<lb/>
the ramp and to secure foothold. Horses pack best if placed athwart<lb/>
the boat, alternately heads and tails. A man is required for each horse.<lb/>
On reaching the ship's side, slinging is carried out as previously described,<lb/>
and however crowded, sufficient room must be reserved on each boat to<lb/>
permit of the first horse being slung without danger.
</p>

<p>
Ejnbaiking by swimming is rarely necessary, but if it has to be done Embark-<lb/>
the slings must be tightly secured on each animal before entering the i"g ^y<lb/>
water. ^^^^"-
</p>

<p>
This is done by stitching them along the back with yarn so that they "^^"^'<lb/>
fit the body closely and will not sag downwards when in the water. If<lb/>
this precaution is not observed, the horse is likely to get a hind leg caught<lb/>
in the slack whilst swimming, and drown. The breast and quarter ropes<lb/>
are securely fastened, and a long rope, about 8 yards, is passed round<lb/>
the top of neck and fastened rather tightly just behind the jaw, with an<lb/>
overhand knot to prevent it slipping. The ropes of the ship's head<lb/>
collar may be looped round the neck to prevent entanglement. The horse<lb/>
is then led into the water as far as he can walk towards the boat, and a<lb/>
man in the stern receives the rope and immediately reeves it through the<lb/>
stern ring of the boat to secure additional power in the event of the horse<lb/>

plunging. If the animal refuses to move towards the boat, splashing<lb/>
water on his back will induce him to. When once swimming the rope<lb/>
should be drawn up towards the boat, which is slowly rowed to the ship.<lb/>
It is important that the boat should not go faster than the horse can<lb/>
swim or his head will be dragged under water ; for this reason the rope<lb/>
should not be made fast but held and regulated by the hand (p. 141).<lb/>
On reaching the ship's side the hook and tackle should be lowered,<lb/>

the details being reversed. The stalls nearest the hatchways should be<lb/>
emptied first and the side rails or parting bars, as they are successively<lb/>
removed, placed where they will not interfere with the free passage of<lb/>
subsequent horses.
</p>

<p>
It is generally better to get everything belonging to men and<lb/>
horses out of the ship before horses are landed, as the men have<lb/>
not then to quit them after disembarkation, but in hot climates the<lb/>
atmosphere between decks when the ship is stationary may cause such<lb/>
sweating and distress that the landing of the horses iDecomes the<lb/>
first consideration. The ordinary head-stall and bridoon will be put on<lb/>
the horses before landing, and when slung the guy rope will be tied to<lb/>
the lower ring of the back strap and the bridoon knotted up to prevent<lb/>
entanglement. A straw or sand bed must be laid on the wharf for the<lb/>
reception of slung horses to prevent injuries from plunging. If exercise<lb/>
on board has not been feasible, attention to this point is the more necessary,<lb/>
as animals are cramped and apt to injure their knees unless carefully<lb/>
handled.
</p>

<p>
Landing m boats or fiats. â Great care is necessary in lowering from<lb/>
the vessel, especially if there is any swell : the tackle must be slacked<lb/>
and detached from the sling the moment the horse touches the boat in<lb/>
order that he may be able to get his footing. If there are no piers or<lb/>
landing stages, boats must be beached and the horses made to jump<lb/>
out.
</p>

<p>
Swimming ashore may be practised on emergency. The horse should<lb/>
be slung over the ship's side, without breast or quarter ropes being<lb/>
secured, and with a neck rope, as described previously (" Embarkation by

<p>
Swimming"), and gently lowered into the water. The sling is detached<lb/>
and the neck rope handled from a boat. It is possible also to swim<lb/>
horses ashore without guiding them, but in such a case it is necessary for<lb/>
picquet boats to be stationed in order to prevent them swimming out to<lb/>
sea. When in the water a horse's range of vision is so limited that he<lb/>
cannot see a shelving beach till very close to it, and some horses should<lb/>
be kept at the landing point to attract the attention of the swimmers.
</p>

<p>
Management on Board.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the last horse is on board the ship should be got under<lb/>
way, and all previous arrangements with regard to embarkation should<lb/>
be made so as to admit of this being done. It is not of such great<lb/>
importance in a cold climate, but in warm countries the distress entailed<lb/>
by the heat in a stationary ship is very great and should be avoided. For<lb/>
the same reason, if on reaching the destination it is found that the horses<lb/>
cannot be landed immediately, the vessel should not anchor, but be kept<lb/>
on the move to secure better ventilation and cooler air.
</p>

<p>
Ventilation and exercise.â \)\ix\Vi&amp;lt;g the voyage the two points which Ventila-<lb/>
demand the greatest attention from all concerned are ventilation and tion and<lb/>
exercise. On the amount of ventilation and exercise together which it is exercise,<lb/>
possible to give depends the condition (not fatness) in which the horses<lb/>
land. The means by which they may be obtained have been previously<lb/>
described; it remains only to note that a constant inspection of every<lb/>
ventilator, outlet and inlet, is necessary. Sufficient and free exits for<lb/>
foul air are as important as entrances for a fresh supply. Canvas wind-<lb/>
sails must be constantly observed and kept free of all obstructions.<lb/>
Exercise and the mucking out of stalls should if possible be carried out<lb/>
together, half the men being employed on each duty alternately ; weather<lb/>
permitting, exercise for each horse of a unit should be continued as long<lb/>
as possible ; it means additional work, and men should be thoroughly<lb/>
taught the reason for its necessity and that their future success and safety<lb/>
may depend upon the condition of the horses on landing.
</p>

<p>
Where a portion of the deck has been specially arranged for exercise<lb/>
and horses can walk two abreast, this work is greatly facilitated,
</p>

<p>
Sa7iitation.âi:\\\% includes the mucking out of the stalls and cleansing Sanita-<lb/>
and disinfection of the decks. On transports carrying units it should be tion.<lb/>
done thoroughly, daily ; but on remount ships with a limited number of<lb/>
attendants this may not be feasible. It should, however, be done as often

<p>
as possible. The method to be adopted is as follows : As many horses as<lb/>
possible are to be taken out of the stalls for exercise (if exercise cannot<lb/>
he given they should be stood in spare stalls or other available space),<lb/>
their stalls are cleared of all droppings, which are placed in skips<lb/>
provided for the purpose ; the platforms are raised, the deck cleaned and<lb/>
the whole sprinkled with the dry disinfectants provided. On exposed<lb/>
decks the salt-water hose is an effectual aid to cleanliness, and the<lb/>
greatest care must be taken not to block the drainage pipes leading from<lb/>
the scuppers. This is a quite common occurrence and the result is that<lb/>
urine collects on the deck instead of draining away, has to be pumped<lb/>
up by hand, and the state of the atmosphere is rendered absolutely<lb/>
poisonous. The keeping free of the scuppers should therefore receive<lb/>
great attention and be the subject of a standing order to all concerned.
</p>

<p>
When it is only possible to move a few horses at a time they may be<lb/>
shifted in rotation into the cleaned stalls and those originally moved placed<lb/>
in the stalls last cleaned.

Watering. Watering. â An ample water supply is essential, and horses should as
</p>

<p>
a rule be watered three, or, if the weather is hot, four times daily. A fresh<lb/>
water force pump is fitted to each stable deck, and a 30-gallon tub is stood<lb/>
by it to dip buckets in ; 3-garion buckets being provided at the rate of<lb/>
one to six animals.
</p>

<p>
Feeding. Feeding. â As regards feeding during a voyage, horses on board ship
</p>

<p>
are under similar conditions to animals standing idle in narrow stalls on<lb/>
shore, and should be fed accordingly, that is, they should receive about<lb/>
half an average ration of corn and a full supply of fodder. This will be<lb/>
sufficient to prevent their falling off in condition without over-feeding them.<lb/>
The question as to exactly how much they receive daily is a matter for<lb/>
some discretion on the part of the commanding officer ; at the beginning<lb/>
of a voyage and during very hot or very rough weather rather less than the<lb/>
average may be advisable ; whilst with favourable conditions and facilities<lb/>
for plenty of exercise a rather more liberal scale would be justified.

It is better to sling it across the front of the stall with a rope to either<lb/>
stanchion so that it is in front of the animal and does not evade his efforts<lb/>
to secure the contents ; feeding hay except from the net is very waste-<lb/>
ful, unless horses are standing under hatchways during fine weather, when<lb/>
ihey may have it on the deck in front of them.

The above routine may be varied to suit circumstances, and is given<lb/>
as a guide only. Where circumstances do not permit of sufficient exercise<lb/>
being given to all horses in the morning it should be continued during the<lb/>
afternoon till completed.
</p>

<p>
During calm weather as many horses as possible should be taken out<lb/>
of their stalls and stood on exposed decks or under hatchways.
</p>

<p>
Duri7tg rough weather men should remain with the horses, and<lb/>
especial attention given to the provision of foothold by the liberal sprinkling<lb/>
of ashes on the platforms.
</p>

<p>
The use of slings is unnecessary, except for veterinary cases. It has<lb/>
been stated that slings are useful if adjusted slackly, so that in the event<lb/>
of horses losing their feet they would be saved a fall, but this can only be<lb/>
the case in short stalls unsuited for horses. Given a stall athwart the<lb/>
ship, with good foothold and length enough to balance himself, and a horse<lb/>
will not fall ; he will, in fact, keep his equilibrium better than his master.

<p>
firmly against the animal's feet), scatter a few ashes to prevent shpping,<lb/>
and he will rise with ease. If the horse struggles and cannot rise, slip<lb/>
parting boards between him and his companions to prevent his injuring<lb/>
or scaring them. In the event of a horse being down on the deck during<lb/>
a storm and it being impossible for him to rise, he becomes a danger to<lb/>
others as he is shot from side to side by the roll ; in such circumstances<lb/>
the feet may be hobbled together and the animal tied firmly to the nearest<lb/>
suitable support, until it is possible to let him get up.
</p>

<p>
Sickness amongst horses on board ship is due to or aggravated by Sickness,<lb/>
excessive heat (fever and heat stroke), want of fresh air (staggers and<lb/>
pneumonia), or want of exercise (fever m the feet). By carrying out the<lb/>
methods previously stated, these may usually be prevented, but in case<lb/>
of any sickness it may be taken for granted that fresh air is wanted, and<lb/>
the patient should be brought under a hatchway immediately. If a horse<lb/>
is suddenly violent (staggers), douching with water after bringing under<lb/>
the hatchway will be found effectual. As a measure of prevention, horses<lb/>
which are stood in badly ventilated stalls (if any) should be moved every<lb/>
few days to better positions.
</p>

<p>
Fever may occur frequently, and horses be off feed as a consequence ;<lb/>
but fresh air only will prove a curative, and medicine is not often<lb/>
necessary.
</p>

<p>
Constipation which is frequent should be overcome by sloppy mashes,<lb/>
and not by physic.
</p>

<p>
Fever in the feet will not occur if exercise is given, and the importance<lb/>
of this cannot be over-estimated. It will, however, occur in unshod<lb/>
remounts which stand still all the voyage and will be exhibited on landing.
</p>

<p>
Care on Landing.
</p>

<p>
Troop horses which have been well exercised during the voyage may<lb/>
be brought on to light work without any interval if necessary, but it is<lb/>
invariably better if time permits to allow as long as possible for<lb/>
graduated exercise on shore before any effort is called for. Remounts,<lb/>
which are embarked soft and not exercised on board, it is impossible to<lb/>
work until they have been thoroughly conditioned ; any attempt to do<lb/>
otherwise can only end in absolute disaster. As a rule such an animal,<lb/>
called on to work immediately, does one day only and is then broken<lb/>
down beyond recovery.
</p>

<p>
The amount of time required for this gradual conditioning, therefore,<lb/>
varies inversely to the fitness of the animal on embarkation, and the<lb/>
amount of fresh air and exercise it receives on the way.
</p>

ANIMAL MANAGEMENT.
</p>

<p>
Feeding.
</p>

<p>
An unshod, grass-fed remount will land foot sore, and cannot even<lb/>
walk far without risk of fever in the feet ; such should be allowed some<lb/>
days' rest to stretch their limbs and gradually restore the healthy<lb/>
circulation of the feet, which, from long standing still, has become weak<lb/>
and easily overstrained. Added to this the horn of the feet is worn thin<lb/>
and soft, and requires a little time before a shoe can be safely fitted.<lb/>
Conditioning for such horses must be gradual.
</p>

<p>
Feeding will naturally be regulated according to work. As much<lb/>
food as possible should be landed with the horses. If the rations on<lb/>
shore are different to those they have been accustomed to, the two<lb/>
varieties can then be mixed, and the change of food made gradually, so<lb/>
as to avoid indigestion and colic.
</p>

<p>
Notes Regarding Shipment of Other Animals.
</p>

<p>
Mules. Mules. â According to the height of the mules shipped, the breast and
</p>

<p>
parting bars should be proportionately lowered. Mules may be, and<lb/>
often are, carried in pens of three to five instead of in separate stalls ; it<lb/>
economises room, but in hot weather they sweat greatly where their sides<lb/>
touch, and the hair rapidly falls off, leaving a bald and sometimes sore<lb/>
patch. If stalls are built expressly for small mules, they may be<lb/>
proportionately shorter.
</p>

<p>
Owing to the animals' propensity for gnawing everything, the<lb/>
woodwork within reach of their teeth should be smeared with soft-soap,<lb/>
and head collar chains substituted for ropes, or the latter soaked in<lb/>
creosote.
</p>

<p>
As regards amount of rations, mules of i4'2 may be fed as cobs, and<lb/>
smaller sizes in proportion.
</p>

<p>
Cattle. Cattle. â Special ships are used for the conveyance of cattle ; they are
</p>

<p>
provided with open cement floors, drainage behind stalls, and feed<lb/>
troughs on the deck. Owing to the fluidity of the excreta, flushing the<lb/>
deck for drainage is not so liable to choke scuppers, and can be more<lb/>
freely made use of.
</p>

<p>
Camels. Camels. â If camels have come a long railway journey to the port of
</p>

<p>
embarkation, they are sure to be stiff and cramped, and should be rested<lb/>
previous to slinging.
</p>

<p>
Slinging. Sli?tomg. â The camel should be made to squat, and a guy rope
</p>

<p>
adjusted to control the head. If this is not done, the nose rope is sure<lb/>
to be pulled on and perhaps torn out. The legs may be tied to<lb/>
prevent rising, or a man stood on each, which is a simpler method. The<lb/>
sling is then slipped under the animal, adjusted and rapidly hoisted.
</p>

TRANSPORT BY RAIL. 267
</p>

<p>
On board they are made to squat, arranged closely along the deck<lb/>
with their heads inwards, athwart the ship, and a rope is passed round<lb/>
both forearms and over the neck to prevent rising. When the ship is<lb/>
under way they may be permitted to rise. They require a deck 8 feet<lb/>
6 inches high to stand comfortably. During rough weather they must be<lb/>
camped and secured as described. Sand is provided to give them<lb/>
foothold on deck.
</p>

<p>
Owing to the long periods camels are compelled to squat (camp)<lb/>
during rail or sea journeys any wound at the bend of the knee or hock<lb/>
is very likely to become much aggravated during a voyage, and, if<lb/>
possible, such cases should not be embarked.
</p>

<p>
Railway Transport.
</p>

<p>
Trucks.â An'imsds are conveyed in trucks, or horse-boxes. Whenever Trucks,<lb/>
it is possible they should be stood at the ends of the trucks parallel to the<lb/>
rails, facing each other, but unless the truck is specially fitted, as in India,<lb/>
or it is possible to fix temporary bars across each side of the door, this<lb/>
arrangement cannot be made and they are then placed across the truck<lb/>
with their head ropes tied to the sides. To prevent horses being frightened<lb/>
their heads should not face towards passing trains.
</p>

<p>
Closed trucks not specially fitted are very hot and should be avoided<lb/>
if possible. If there is no arrangement for tying up the horses their head<lb/>
ropes should be looped up before they are lelt. English cattle trucks hold<lb/>
six to nine horses, according to size ; Cape trucks eight to ten ; Indian vans<lb/>
eight to ten.
</p>

<p>
Eiitraiiiing. â If from a platform the sides of the door let down and form Entrain-<lb/>
a bridge to the truck ; if not from a platform, a ramp must be specially ing-<lb/>
provided, and where it is known beforehand that this will be the case,<lb/>
temporary gangways with suitable cross battens to give foothold should<lb/>
be provided. The only difficulty which occurs is from the nervousness of<lb/>
some horses to step across or up the ramp. This with untrained animals<lb/>
may give considerable trouble (see " Method of Dealing with Troublesome<lb/>
Animals during Embarkation "), but with troop horses practice in entraining<lb/>
should be part of their normal training and regularly carried out. Where<lb/>
dummy waggons exist for this practice, the space between the platform<lb/>
and the carriage should be accurately represented, as this is the cause of<lb/>
hesitation in horses trained on a dummy with a solid ramp to the truck's<lb/>
^^^â¢gQ. Horses should be led quietly into the trucks, a reliable one chosen<lb/>
to lead, and the man stepping in without looking back at the horse ; if<lb/>
one goes in, the rest fo low easily, though some will always jump in. The

<p>
great thing" is to take it all quietly and without upsetting animals by noise<lb/>
and violence. Keep troublesome ones till last. With adequate training<lb/>
they will generally walk in and out like sheep. Sand should be used on<lb/>
the floor of the truck to prevent slipping.
</p>

<p>
Harness on journeys. â It may be necessary to keep harness on during<lb/>
raibvay journeys ; but if it is not essential for operations, it should be<lb/>
removed and loaded in separate trucks, as the animals travel better<lb/>
stripped, and the gear is less liable to damage. In any case, care must be<lb/>
taken to remove bits and slacken all girths and surcingles, neglect of<lb/>
which latter precaution has been known to cause severe injuries from long-<lb/>
continued pressure.
</p>

<p>
Horse-boxes are constructed to hold three animals in separate padded<lb/>
compartments, parallel to the line of rails. When loaded, the horses,<lb/>
should be tied short by the head to prevent accidents from their trying to<lb/>
turn in the stall or getting their forelegs up in the manger. Owing to<lb/>
the shortness of these stalls, knees and tails are liable to get bruised, and<lb/>
kneecaps and a tail guard are advisible. When a tail is bandaged to<lb/>
prevent its being rubbed, it must not be wrapped too tightly, or the pressure<lb/>
may cause the hair to fall out ; a better method is to encase the tail in a<lb/>
leather sheath which buckles or laces like a legging and is kept in position<lb/>
by a strap leading from the top to the roller pad.
</p>

<p>
Mules. â The habit these animals possessof gnawing woodwork should<lb/>
not be forgotten when they are tied to truck sides ; a smearing of soft-<lb/>
soap will prevent it.
</p>

<p>
Camels. â The height of the camel necessitates his being carried in a<lb/>
sitting position. They may be made to squat on the platform, the fore<lb/>
and hind legs tied, and then be hoisted on to a truck, or they may, if<lb/>
space permit, step on to the truck previous to squatting. They should, of<lb/>
course, be unloaded and allowed exercise as often as possible, and as they<lb/>
are invariably very cramped at the end of a railway journey, should be<lb/>
given time to recover the use of their limbs thoroughly before marching or<lb/>
embarking for oversea transport.
</p>

<p>
Watering. â Adequate arrangements for water are necessary, and must<lb/>
be thought out beforehand. In properly fitted trucks and horse-boxes it<lb/>
offers no difficulty, but with large numbers in cattle trucks it is often<lb/>
difficult to water satisfactorily. Water may be given from buckets or the<lb/>

horses are trained, troughs handy, and time permits. Horses known<lb/>
to be troublesome should not be detrained, but watered by hand. If<lb/>
watering by buckets has to be adopted, the best method is to put one man<lb/>
in the truck and pass buckets to him. In hot climates, watering becomes

a matter of the greatest importance, and advance information should<lb/>
always be wired to halting places, so that trains may be shunted at once<lb/>
to their proper sidings and near the water supply.
</p>

<p>
Feeding en route.â Y\.(^x^ again the fitting of the truck is all-important, Feeding<lb/>
and in cattle trucks where horses are loose or tied to the sides it is waste en route,<lb/>
to attempt to feed with hay, any thrown on the floor of the truck being<lb/>
rapidly trampled up with the droppings of the animals. Corn and chaff<lb/>
may be given in nosebags, one or tv/o men being left in the truck during<lb/>
feeding.
</p>

<p>
If for military reasons long journeys have to be made in unfitted<lb/>
trucks, a special halt of sufficient duration to detrain, water and feed with<lb/>
corn and hay twice every 24 hours (say a total of three hours) should be<lb/>
arranged for, if the journey is to last more than a day, and horses are to<lb/>
keep in condition. If the circumstances do not admit of so much time being<lb/>
devoted to feeding and watering they will lose in condition, anditbecomes<lb/>
a question for the commanding officer as to which is the most desirable<lb/>
course to pursue.
</p>

<p>
With fitted trucks as described below the necessity for long halts is<lb/>
not so urgent, though advisable if time permits, and horses can be fed<lb/>
with hay en route.
</p>

<p>
The danger of fire when hay is used in trucks, owing to red-hot<lb/>
cinders from the engine, should be explained to all attendants, and on the<lb/>
same account all smoking should be prohibited.
</p>

<p>
In India, all trucks for conveyance of horses are provided with a breast In India,<lb/>
bar across on each side of the door. When the truck is in ordinary use<lb/>
for goods this bar is sunk level with the floor or fixed near the roof, and<lb/>
raised or lowered when required. The floor arrangement is most con-<lb/>
venient. Four large or five small horses or mules are packed in each end,<lb/>
and the breast bar having been adjusted their head ropes are tied to it.<lb/>
The doors at both sides can then be left open and the space in the centre<lb/>
is occupied by forage and attendants. Corn is fed from nosebags and hay<lb/>
from a blanket stretched between the breast bars. It is a simple,<lb/>
inexpensive arrangement, which admits of troop horses, performing long<lb/>
railway journeys, being properly fed en route.

CHAPTER X.
</p>

<p>
THE MULE.
</p>

<p>
Of all pack animals the mule is the favourite, and although frequently-<lb/>
employed as a draught or riding animal, it is as a pack carrier that we<lb/>
know him best. He is capable of great endurance, tolerates thirst well,<lb/>
can put up with changes of climate and food, and is not fastidious<lb/>
regarding the latter. The shape of his back makes it easy to fit him<lb/>
with a saddle, while the toughness of his hide helps to preserve it from<lb/>
galls. Mules are usually cheerful, intelligent animals, appreciate proper<lb/>
handling, and resent violence. They are particularly free kickers, often<lb/>
shy with strangers, and touchy about the head and ears ; but with<lb/>
attendants that understand them, they are by no means troublesome,<lb/>
- and easy to look after and keep in condition.
</p>

<p>
Their one drawback from a military standpoint is their liability to<lb/>
stampede under fire. This, however, may be largely overcome by<lb/>
training, as is witnessed by the mountain artillery of India.
</p>

<p>
Mules vary in height from twelve to seventeen hands. Big American<lb/>
and Spanish mules are utilised in draught or for riding, but I4*2 is about<lb/>
the largest employed for packwork. North and South American,<lb/>
Spanish, Italian, Maltese, Cyprian, Egyptian, Syrian, Abyssinian,<lb/>
Persian, Chinese, Indian, and Cape mules have all been employed by<lb/>
us at various times, and with the exception of large Spanish mules,<lb/>
evidently unsuited for packwork, all have been satisfactory.
</p>

<p>
Being a near relation of the horse, and with a digestive system of<lb/>
the same pattern, all the general rules for the care of horses may be<lb/>
applied to mules, and if equal attention is paid to their stable<lb/>
management and feeding, they are much easier to keep in condition<lb/>
when at hard work.<lb/>
Selection. Selection. Conformation. â The shape of the back is the first con-
</p>

<p>
sideration. It should be straight from wither to croup, or inclined to<lb/>
be roach backed, rather than hollow. It should be well covered with<lb/>
muscle, broad and level on the top, and short. A long back is a weak<lb/>
back, and if also hollow and narrow is the worst shape for a mule.

The above measurements are when the animals are in working<lb/>

more must be looked for all round. Mules less than I2'i, and four<lb/>
years old, are only purchased by special sanction.

common cause of unfitness.

ANIMAL MANAGEMENT.

<p>
Feeding.
</p>

<p>
The first pair of permanent incisors appear between two and three years,<lb/>
and are in wear at three ; at four years four permanent teeth are in wear<lb/>
and at five the whole six are present. The corner tooth may not be<lb/>
fully in wear over its whole surface till six years, and subsequent to this<lb/>
age the changes are similar to those seen in the horse's mouth.
</p>

<p>
The age at which mules are fit for transport work, is four years for<lb/>
light work, five years for hard work. They are better at six, and work<lb/>
satisfactorily till eighteen or twenty, sometimes even longer. In the<lb/>
hurried buying that often precedes a campaign, the age will, sometimes,<lb/>
depend upon the number which must be obtained in a given time, but<lb/>
those of full age should be bought first, and the immature ones under<lb/>
pressure of necessity only. For campaign purposes a comparatively oH<lb/>
animal in working condition is more serviceable than a fresh, fat,<lb/>
young one.
</p>

<p>
Feeding. â The rules for feeding horses are applicable in every<lb/>
particular to mules, and the quantities required are, size for size, about<lb/>
the same, but mules are generally able to keep condition on a somewhat<lb/>
less generous diet, and are not, as a rule, at all fastidious as to the<lb/>
quality of the forage offered to them.
</p>

<p>
The scale of mule rations adopted in India is as follows :â
</p>

<p>
Pack mules,<lb/>
1st class, and<lb/>
draught mules.

THE MULE. 273
</p>

<p>
If the grain ration is of inferior quality, an extra allowance of i^ lbs.<lb/>
to first class, and i lb. to second class mules is allowed.
</p>

<p>
With bigger mules than those employed in India, the rations are<lb/>
correspondingly larger.
</p>

<p>
In the "pack trains " employed bv the American army to accompany<lb/>
their cavalry, the mules, which may range from 13^ to 16 hands, but<lb/>
are preferred at about 14, are allowed 9 lbs. of oats, corn (maize), bran or<lb/>
barley, and 14 lbs. of hay. They are fed twice daily, the grain being<lb/>
placed on sacks or canvas covers. The morning feed is light, and the<lb/>
balance of grain and all the hay given at the evening feed. These mules<lb/>
are required to keep touch with cavalry as regards marching powers.
</p>

<p>
In the Abyssinian campaign, where the mules are said to have<lb/>
averaged 14 hands, the ration was at first 5 lbs. grain and 12 lbs. hay ;<lb/>
but this was subsequently increased to 8 lbs. of beans and 1 5 lbs. of hay.
</p>

<p>
In the Zulu war North American mules, averaging 15 "2, and used<lb/>
for draught, were given 8 lbs. maize, 12 lbs. oat-hay, i oz. salt, and as<lb/>
much grazing as possible. Cape and South American mules, I3'2,<lb/>
received 5 lbs. maize, 5 lbs. oat-hay, and ^ oz. salt.
</p>

<p>
The Chinese, who are very careful in feeding their ponies and mules,<lb/>
give 10 lbs. to 12 lbs. grain (Kaoliang, a millet) daily to a big mule of<lb/>
15 hands or over.
</p>

<p>
Wateri?ig. â In the matter of water, mules are somewhat dainty, and Watering,<lb/>
if the supply is not to their taste will, unless extremely thirsty, decline to<lb/>
drink. Like horses, they are somewhat creatures of habit in this respect,<lb/>
and although refusing to drink from a stream, may take the same water<lb/>
freely from the bucket or other vessel they are used to. When very<lb/>
thirsty, they may drink as much as a horse or pony of similar size, but<lb/>
under ordinary circumstances they are not greedy drinkers, and generally<lb/>
endure thirst well.
</p>

<p>
Marching with mules. â On the march mules can be led or driven Marching<lb/>
The latter is a very usual method, and when so trained, they may be with<lb/>
trusted to carry bulky loads on narrow roads and steep hills with perfect "^"les.<lb/>
safety. The "pack train " males of the American army are accustomed<lb/>
to follow a " bell " mare, and they move quite independently once they<lb/>
are loaded.
</p>

<p>
The pace of mule transport is from three to four miles an hour, the<lb/>
mule being a quick walker. A short stepping, active pace is preferred to<lb/>
long striding action as being less likely to shift the load, and so incur<lb/>
risk of galling. The American mules alluded to above are said to move<lb/>
at an amble " or "jog " when required, and have covered as much as<lb/>
100 miles in a day, carrying a load of 250 lbs.

<p>
Shoei
</p>

<p>
The ordinary distance of which mule transport is capable is 20 to<lb/>
25 miles a day, carrying 160 lbs. and the saddle ; and this only when in<lb/>
gl^ood condition, if the rate is to be maintained for a considerable<lb/>
period.
</p>

<p>
After a march, the loads having been removed, the girths should be<lb/>
gradually slackened, unless it is quite certain that the animal's condition<lb/>
is so hard that girth swellings will not result from suddenly releasing the<lb/>
pressure on the skin.
</p>

<p>
Halts. â When unsaddled mules should be allowed to roll, a proceeding<lb/>
they thoroughly enjoy and one which rapidly dries the heated back.<lb/>
They are usually shackled by foot shackles with short chains, as they<lb/>
invariably chew ropes.
</p>

<p>
They should be grazed wherever this is practicable, and the practice<lb/>
of herding them and teaching them to follow a bell mare is very useful<lb/>
for this purpose.
</p>

<p>
The herding of mules, that is, teaching them to graze quietly when<lb/>
turned loose, is paid particular attention to in America, and certainly is<lb/>
a great advantage if it can be done.
</p>

<p>
CrossJ?ig rivers. â Mules are good swimmers, and can ford fairly deep<lb/>
streams, but great care must be exercised in fording with loads on, as the<lb/>
animal is top heavy, and if taken out of its depth will probably turn on<lb/>
its side and drown. As a rule loads should be removed unless it is<lb/>
certain that the ford is practicable. In swimming, the same rules as for<lb/>
horses are applicable.
</p>

<p>
SJioei7ig. â Wherever the work and roads cause excessive wear of the<lb/>
feet, mules are shod in exactly the same way as horses. Their feet generally<lb/>
are strong, the horn tough, thick and quick growing, so that on unmetalled<lb/>
roads they are frequently worked unshod. In such cases all the attention<lb/>
necessary is to round off the edges of the wall occasionally to prevent<lb/>
it splitting, and to lower the heels or shorten the toes if required, in order<lb/>
to keep the hoof to its proper proportions. As a rule the feet are<lb/>
inclined to grow high at the heels, and this is the point which wants most<lb/>
frequent attention.

<p>
The donkey is for his size an excellent pack animal, and is so<lb/>

only 100 lbs. against 160 lbs., but they demand comparatively little

They are particularly hardy, useful pack animals, if they are not over-<lb/>

they can cover fifteen miles a day.
</p>

<p>
The saddle of pack donkeys is generally a pattern known as the<lb/>
" sunka." A " sunka " is a bolster stuffed with straw and supple sticks<lb/>
or canes, which is doubled in the centre, and its sides tied close together.<lb/>
The bend of the bolster is placed well in front of the animal's withers, so<lb/>
that these and the spines of the backbone lie in the space between the<lb/>
doubled portions, and on this the load is supported.
</p>

<p>
Both beneath and above the " sunka " a thick layer of blankets is<lb/>
arranged to form a protective pad, and when in skilled hands it gives<lb/>
fairly good results. As, however, everything depends on the skill of the<lb/>
attendants in arranging this simple form of saddle, it is quite unsuited for<lb/>
transport which is not very thoroughly acquainted with it, and is in any<lb/>
case inferior to a good pack saddle of the right size.

<p>
THE CAMEL.
</p>

<p>
Camels may be divided into two classes : double humped<lb/>
and single humped. The double humped camel, also called the<lb/>
" Bactrian," is found in Turkestan, and throughout Central Asia. This is<lb/>
a long-haired, sturdy, powerful animal, bred in and accustomed to<lb/>
rigorous climates, and capable of marching in snow-covered mountains.<lb/>
This variety has been utilized by the Russians in their central Asian<lb/>
expeditions, but is not found in any of the regions where we have made<lb/>
use of camel transport.
</p>

<p>
The single-humped camel, which is alluded to in the following<lb/>
chapter, is found in Arabia, Northern Africa, Egypt, Abyssinia, Somali-<lb/>
land and India. Generally speaking, it is longer legged, lighter built,<lb/>
and shorter coated than the Bactrian, and bred in hotter climates. The<lb/>
two varieties inter-breed, but the cross is said to be useful and hardy<lb/>
only when the sire is Bactrian. Breeding has been specialized to such an<lb/>
extent that the riding camel (Sowari, India ; Hagheen, Egypt) forms<lb/>
a distinct class as compared with the baggage animal, and may be aptly<lb/>
compared to our thoroughbred horse. For the formation of special<lb/>
camel corps such as were employed by Napoleon, and by ourselves at a<lb/>
later date, in Egypt, and by Napier in India, riding camels alone are<lb/>
suitable, but as a rule the camel on service is a baggage animal, and it is<lb/>
to the consideration of him in particular that these notes are devoted.
</p>

<p>
As a transport animal the camel can, under suitable conditions, carry<lb/>
250 to 450 lbs. twenty miles daily, and this must be looked upon as the<lb/>
limit of his normal powers when properly cared for. It is well to keep<lb/>
this in mind, for the animal's virtues are such that it is easy to unwittingly<lb/>
overtax him. Patient to a degree, enduring hunger, thirst and pain with<lb/>
a stoical courage beyond all others, the first sign a camel may give that<lb/>
he is being asked to do the impossible is to drop down dead, on which<lb/>
account he has been classed as " delicate." The one point on which a<lb/>
camel may be fairly regarded as delicate is, that he is peculiarly<lb/>
susceptible to changes of climate and surroundings. You cannot, for<lb/>
instance, work a desert camel successfully in the hills, or a delta camel<lb/>
in the desert ; but if properly selected and cared for they make<lb/>
excellent transport, are not more difficult to deal wuth than other animals,<lb/>
and on occasion are capable of a sustained effort which cannot be<lb/>
accomplished by any others. They are, however, unintelligent ; they<lb/>
cannot be taught much, but are willing machines and must be driven with<lb/>
care and judgment.

THE CAMEL. 277
</p>

<p>
Select io7i. â The camels selected for any particular service must, as Selection.<lb/>
pre\'iously stated, be suitable to the local conditions under which they<lb/>
are expected to work, of sufficient age and good conformation. The<lb/>
opportunity for watering in the Somaliland desert may occur only every<lb/>
three or four days, and perhaps not for a week ; the camel from the<lb/>
delta of Egypt, accustomed for generations to green food and plenty of .<lb/>
water, will not endure such conditions, while any desert bred camel would<lb/>
do so. On the Kirghiz steppes the camels are under-sized, shaggy<lb/>
animals with lion-like manes, accustomed to work in deep snow, but are<lb/>
incapable of standing the climate of the desert, as indeed are any bred<lb/>
in cool climates. It is then imperative that the animals chosen for any<lb/>
expedition must be suited to the local conditions as far as practicable.
</p>

<p>
India7i camels generally stand heat and thirst well, except such as Indian,<lb/>
come from Baluchistan and the extreme north.
</p>

<p>
Egyptian camels if desert or crossed desert-delta breed are suited Egyptian,<lb/>
to hot, dry regions, but the animal bred in the delta is a big, soft creature,<lb/>
unable to withstand the privations of desert life, especially on service,<lb/>
though an excellent means of transport in his own locality. In the<lb/>
Soudan at least seven breeds are found among the tribes. The<lb/>
Bisharin and Kababish are, perhaps, the most noted. The former are<lb/>
of light, well-bred appearance, capable of great endurance but unsuited<lb/>
to heavy loads. The Kababish, from the Bayuda desert, are large,<lb/>
strong and accustomed to find their own living in the desert ; they are,<lb/>
therefore, considered valuable when grain feeding is not to be procured,<lb/>
but require plenty of grazing.
</p>

<p>
Arabian camels are comparatively small and light, but are good Arabian,<lb/>
workers in hot regions, and are accustomed to grain feeding, without<lb/>
which they rapidly fall off in condition.
</p>

<p>
Abyssinian camels are strong, short-legged and compact, and good Abys-<lb/>
workers, suitable for hot climates. sinian.
</p>

<p>
Somali camels are small and light, but capable of keeping condition Somali,<lb/>
when water is scarce, as they are accustomed to go several days without<lb/>
watering. It does not appear, from recent experience, that they are so<lb/>
generally hardy and useful as the Indian, Arab or Abyssinian varieties.<lb/>
All varieties just mentioned are only suitable for work in hot climates ;<lb/>
if camels are ever required to winter in a rigorous climate they<lb/>
must be selected from breeds accustomed to such severe weather, or<lb/>
enormous mortality will inevitably result.
</p>

<p>
As:e.âK judicious selection with respect to age is important, as the Age.<lb/>
permanent incisor teeth are not sufficiently numerous until the animal is<lb/>
at least six years old to enable it to get a living under active service

conditions. The mouth is a wreck between four and six years, and the<lb/>
teeth cannot cut and tear the tough thorn or hard fibrous plant which form a<lb/>
large portion of the camel's grazing. If worked under campaign<lb/>
conditions at this period the beast practically starves.
</p>

<p>
The milk or temporary teeth commence to appear in the lower jaw<lb/>
either at or shortly after birth, and at hvo 7ii07iths the six temporary<lb/>
incisors are cut, being very small and overlapping at their edges. At<lb/>
twelve inojiths they are well up and in wear, and as the jaw grows bigger<lb/>
and wider they no longer overlap but become separated from each other.<lb/>
At two years there are still only temporary teeth, well worn and quite<lb/>
separated ; at three they are more worn, and at four they are mere<lb/>
stumps, wide apart, peg like, discoloured and, for hard grazing, of httle<lb/>
use. At four and a half to jive years the central pair of permanent teeth<lb/>
are cut, and the other pairs in succession yearly, so that at six years the<lb/>
animal has four (central and lateral), and at seven years six (central,<lb/>
lateral, and corner) permanent incisor teeth in the lower jaw. In<lb/>
addition there are also, on each side of the lower jaw, two tushes, which<lb/>
are somewhat irregular in the time of their appearance, but are usually<lb/>
in evidence at six and fully up at eight years.
</p>

<p>
In the upper jaw there are three tush-like teeth on each side which<lb/>
are cut between five and six, and are also fully up at eight. There are<lb/>
no front teeth in the upper jaw, their place being occupied by a hard gum<lb/>
similar to that seen in the ox.
</p>

<p>
When the permanent incisor teeth first appear they are broad, white,<lb/>
sharp-edged cutting teeth which slightly overlap each other at the edges ;<lb/>
but as they get worn they lose their sharp outline, become first of all<lb/>
grooved on their edges from tearing at hard and tough plants, and subse-<lb/>
quently worn down into discoloured, brown, rounded stumps, quite separate<lb/>
from each other. When they first appear their cutting edges project<lb/>
almost horizontally out of the jaw, but with increasing age they get more<lb/>
and more upright, and become not unlike the stumps of aged horses.<lb/>
These changes take place gradually between the ages of ten and fifteen,<lb/>
after which the teeth are not in themselves as reliable a guide as when<lb/>
considered with other signs of age. From the very tough nature of<lb/>
much of the camel's natural fodder the teeth are liable to get broken, and<lb/>
though this is usually a sign of years, it is not necessarily so. At about<lb/>
fifteen the hair on the tail becomes white, the eye sometimes loses its<lb/>
translucency, and the hollows over the eyes become markedly deeper.
</p>

<p>
The animal attains its prime at nine. For military purposes seven to<lb/>
twelve are suitable ages for purchase, and under no consideration should<lb/>
camels be bought for immediate service under six, though they may be

taken up to fifteen or more if their teeth are quite good and they are<lb/>
otherwise suitable.
</p>

<p>
The most usual error that is made by the inexperienced in ageing Errors in<lb/>
camels is to mistake well grown two or three year olds with worn milk agoing,<lb/>
teeth for full grown animals, but a comparison of the milk and permanent<lb/>
teeth should enable a careful observer to avoid this difficulty. The size<lb/>
and strength of the permanent tooth is of itself sufficient guide ; when worn<lb/>
to a stump it is a thick, strong, round, brown stump, something like a very<lb/>
old horse tooth ; the milk tooth is half, or less than half, the size, and<lb/>
when worn to a stump is a blackened, shapeless little scrap, without any<lb/>
firmness of attachment to the gum. The gum itself is, in the young<lb/>
mouth, plump, tender, and rosy, while in that of the veteran it is lean,<lb/>
tough, and rather yellow than pink.
</p>

<p>
Cofifonnation. â A well nourished, healthy camel has the head erect, Conforma-<lb/>
the eyes clear, the ears pricked, and the hump rounded, plump and tion.<lb/>
vertical, or only with a very slight inclination to one side. The chest<lb/>
should be deep, and the forelegs move freely on each side of it without<lb/>
touching and without splaying. The body should be comparatively short,<lb/>
and well ribbed up, the belly well rounded, and the hindquarters plump,<lb/>
muscular, and not too bent at the hocks. The paces should be easy,<lb/>
with an undulating movement, free from lameness, and without crossing<lb/>
of the hind or splaying of the fore limbs, both of which probably denote<lb/>
injury from slipping up, and inability to carry a load. The callosity<lb/>
beneath the chest upon which the weight of the animal is supported<lb/>
when kneeling, should be deep, large, and free from fissures. The pads<lb/>
of the feet should be large, elastic, and also free from cracks. The stride<lb/>
at the walk is six to seven feet, and the ordinary pace two and a half<lb/>
miles an hour for " baggagers," and up to twelve miles for riding camels.
</p>

<p>
Exauiiiintion for pm'chase. â In examining camels it is well not to be Examina-<lb/>
foolhardy, for although they are very easy to handle, they are, neverthe- tion for<lb/>
less, sometimes apt to resent approach by the white man, and they can purchase,<lb/>
kick with considerable violence. They can cow kick up to the point of<lb/>
the shoulder and sweep the foot outwards and backwards to a<lb/>
considerable range. With the forefoot they can strike forwards and also<lb/>
kick sharply upwards towards the elbow. They have been known to<lb/>
kneel on a man after knocking him down. It is only when standing,<lb/>
however, that they are troublesome ; when sitting they are no trouble,<lb/>
and although they make strange gurgling noises in the mouth they are<lb/>
very rarely known to bite. When ageing, stand to one side, as saliva<lb/>
and food is sometimes shot out of the mouth when it is opened, especially<lb/>
if they are ruminating. When beginning to handle the animal the nose

<p>
ANIMAL MANAGEMENT.
</p>

<p>
Walk<lb/>
round the<lb/>
animal.
</p>

<p>
Have the<lb/>
camel<lb/>
walked to<lb/>
and fro<lb/>
and subse-<lb/>
quently<lb/>
trotted.
</p>

<p>
Make the<lb/>
camel sit<lb/>
down.
</p>

<p>
rope should be held by the attendant {serwan) and a careful examination<lb/>
in the sitting position can then be carried out with perfect safety.
</p>

<p>
(i) Walk round the animal^ noting the general suitability for the<lb/>
purpose required and, carefully, the condition of the skin for mange. A<lb/>
baggager should be of a stouter build and more muscular appearance<lb/>
generally than the riding camel. The latter is longer of leg, lighter of<lb/>
bone and run up in the flank like a greyhound. The hump is a general<lb/>
index to health and condition. It should be firm and plump, inclined<lb/>
backwards rather than forwards, and upright or very nearly so. In riding<lb/>
camels it is generally smaller than in baggagers.
</p>

<p>
For whatever purpose the animal is required, the deep-chested<lb/>
specimen is what is wanted ; those with shallow girth and narrow chest<lb/>
having no stamina. During this stage of the examination, note the<lb/>
condition of the chest pad, the strength and straightness of the limbs,<lb/>
that the tendons are not enlarged from sprains, that the sides of the<lb/>
chest are not scored by galls at the level of the elbow, and if a female<lb/>
that she is not pregnant. If possible it is better to avoid purchasing<lb/>
females at all.
</p>

<p>
(2) Have the camel walked to and fro a?id subsequently trotted.<lb/>
Stand first at each side and then end on to the animal. Note freedom<lb/>
from lameness, straightness of action and freedom from elbow galling.<lb/>
There should be no rolling or crossing of the limbs in movement. The<lb/>
camel is liable to serious sprains from " slipping up " or " splitting," and<lb/>
as a result is unable to carry weight, an inability which is sometimes to<lb/>
be detected by the action. If the animal has slipped up badly, the hind<lb/>
legs may be crossed, and the fore-legs " splayed,'' when he is going, and<lb/>
any suspicious ones should be thoroughly tested under a load,<lb/>
or otherwise rejected. Elbow brushing is also a serious fault,<lb/>
resulting from the friction of the leg against the side, in animals which<lb/>
have the elbow tied in. It is a constant trouble, and with animals in<lb/>
hard work, impossible to prevent. Animals which show it should not<lb/>
be bought for a campaign.
</p>

<p>
(3) Make the camel sit down, age him, examine the nostrils, head,<lb/>
eyes, hump, back, and loins ; pluck at the hair or brush off mud wherever<lb/>
there may be a suspicion of a sore. Look carefully at the foot pads,<lb/>
and specially examine the skin for signs of mange, at any places which<lb/>
were noted during (i).
</p>

<p>
As the animal sits down, it should be noted whether this is done<lb/>
easily and without effort or trembling ; the condition of the chest pad<lb/>
should also be observed, and whether the weight is rested on it without<lb/>
hesitation. This pad, if not very thick, is liable to get wounded, or

<p>
rubbed sore, and may be a constant source of trouble. The examination<lb/>
of the hump and back should be careful, as dealers, with intent to<lb/>
deceive, plug- old wounds, gum hair over sores, or smear mud on the<lb/>
back, as if the animal had been rolling. Any suspicious place should<lb/>
therefore receive great attention. The sides of the hump and ribs, and<lb/>
the spines of the loins are the most likely situations to be injured. The<lb/>
nostrils should be looked at to see that they have not been lacerated by<lb/>
the nose peg being pulled out, a condition which often means a trouble-<lb/>
some animal, but may be due to accident or brutality. Marks of tiring<lb/>
on the head, unless they are well-known brands of some particular<lb/>
breeder or tribe, mean that the animal has had staggers, and may be a<lb/>
cause for rejection. The eyesight should be perfect or the animal<lb/>
cannot graze to advantage ; in old camels, partial or total blindness is<lb/>
common, and a practical test, by holding food within sight, should be<lb/>
adopted in doubtful cases. The foot pads should be large, hard and well-<lb/>
developed, and the toe nails sound and free from splits. Small pads are<lb/>
indicative of want of endurance.
</p>

<p>
(4) Put on a full load, 250 to 450 pounds, according to the size and Put on a<lb/>
variety, and make the animal rise. A ready method is to make two fuH load,<lb/>
sufficiently heavy men join hands over the back. The uprising should<lb/>
be accomplished easily, without hesitation or trembling of the hind<lb/>
quarters.
</p>

<p>
The stringency of examination must depend on the numbers required,<lb/>
and the time within which they must be got. It must not be expected<lb/>
that very large numbers of working animals will be found free from every<lb/>
possible defect, and if certain numbers vmst be bought in a certain time,<lb/>
the main point to remember is that the animals wanted are those that<lb/>
are in full work at the moment, and able to continue doing it. Mange,<lb/>
sore-backs, youth, and pregnancy, are the chief things to avoid. Dealers<lb/>
and tribes show their w^orst animals first as a rule, hoping to obtain the<lb/>
maximum price for them ; they are experts at hiding sores, as stated<lb/>
above, and they fill the animals with water just previous to exhibition, to<lb/>
give the belly a plump appearance.

Structural and other Peculiarities of the Camel.

The lips are extremely mobile and the upper one is bifid. The eyes The lips,<lb/>
are very prominent, and liable to injury, but are protected from exposure<lb/>

<p>
incisor teeth in the bottom jaw only, the top having a hard pad of gum,<lb/>
at each side of which are three tusk-Hke teeth. The mouth is constantly<lb/>
opened, and gurgling, bellowing sounds emitted, which arouse some<lb/>
distrust in those unaccustomed to handling the animal. During these
</p>

<p>
The sounds, the " palu," a bladder-like membrane from the back of the mouth,
</p>

<p>
"palu.' is brought into view, and occasionally protrudes beyond the lips. It<lb/>
appears to be a special provision for moistening the back of the throat,<lb/>
and if this is correct is a very useful help in combating thirst. It is also<lb/>
very much in evidence during the rutting season. On the top of the<lb/>
head is found a gland, the surface of which becomes quite moist during<lb/>
exertion, while the rest of the skin is quite dry.
</p>

<p>
The skin. The skin should be free from scurf, and thickening in the bends of the
</p>

<p>
joints, but on the knees, elbows, stifles and hocks, it shows thickened,<lb/>
roughened patches, hard enough to prevent damage to the<lb/>
parts when the animal is kneeling or sitting, which is its normal position<lb/>
for rest. Under the chest is a large boss, with a hard surface, on which<lb/>
the weight is rested, and this should be particularly well developed, thick,<lb/>
and free from wounds or soreness.
</p>

<p>
The hump. The hump is a fatty, fibrous lump developed on the summit of the<lb/>
back. Its actual size varies considerably according to breed ; it is,<lb/>
generally speaking, smaller in riding and desert camels than other<lb/>
varieties. It has been regarded as a sort of reserve stock of food on<lb/>
which the animal subsists during privation. It is true that the hump<lb/>
wastes in starving or sick camels, and wastes rapidly, but as it is very<lb/>
small in some desert camels, which are amongst the hardiest varieties,<lb/>
it can hardly be regarded as a reserve larder, but rather as a peculiarity<lb/>
of breed and locality. Its condition, whether naturally large or small is,<lb/>
however, a correct index of health and fitness. In health it is firm,<lb/>
plump, and upright. In disease, under privation, and in extreme age, it<lb/>
shrinks and gets flabby, often leaning much to one side.
</p>

<p>
The feet. The feet are formed for travelling over soft sand in particular, but
</p>

<p>
are equally suitable for any ground which gives a firm foothold. The<lb/>
toes are not distinct, but are embedded in a large elastic pad, the under<lb/>
surface being of horny consistence and carrying short, strong nails at the<lb/>
front. When the foot comes to the ground, the whole pad flattens out<lb/>
and gives an ideal foothold on loose sand. It is, however, ill adapted<lb/>
for muddy, slippery ground, and over such, the animal is unable to travel<lb/>
with ease or safety. This peculiarity leads to the accident known as<lb/>
" splitting " or " slipping up," Both hind and fore legs are liable to slip<lb/>
out sideways and severe sprains or broken shoulders or hips result. The<lb/>
accident is most common and severe in the hind limbs and if a fracture

<p>
does not occur, the strain of the muscles inside the thig^hs is often so<lb/>
severe as to incapacitate the animal from carrying a load in future.
</p>

<p>
The digestive system calls for special notice as regards the stomachs, The<lb/>
for on account of their peculiar structure the idea has become prevalent digestive<lb/>
that the animal is possessed of a water storage system which only needs system,<lb/>
replenishing at infrequent intervals. Like other ruminants, the stomach<lb/>
is divided into four compartments.
</p>

<p>
The paunch is very small in the young, but develops into the largest<lb/>
compartment in the adult animal. On its sides are a number of small<lb/>
cells or sacs which on post mortem examination always contain a quantity<lb/>
of grumous fluid, a mixture of food and water. The capacity of the cells<lb/>
on the right side is about a quart, on the left side about a gallon. Their<lb/>
contents are usually not nearly so much and the fluid is not pure water,<lb/>
but a mixture of food, water and mucus. They may be a means of<lb/>
storing fluid, but the idea that a camel keeps the supply of days in these<lb/>
sacs does not bear investigation.
</p>

<p>
The honeycomb, or second stomach, is aptly described by this popular<lb/>
name, and consists of a deep and intricate network of compartments<lb/>
exactly like a honeycomb. It also usually contains a fluid mixture of<lb/>
water and food.
</p>

<p>
The third stomach is not so well developed as in the ox, and the fourth<lb/>
compartment is where the digestion of food really commences. The<lb/>
camel like other ruminants can go for long periods without water, but has<lb/>
no special water storage except as above described ; and his treatment in<lb/>
this respect when on service calls for the exercise of common sense<lb/>
(p. 289).
</p>

<p>
The temper of the Camel is peculiar. Though as a rule docile under The<lb/>
attendants who understand them, they are liable to sudden fits of rage temper ot<lb/>
which are most pronounced in the male during the rutting season, and on ^^^ eamel.<lb/>
this account it is advisable to keep males and females apart when at work.<lb/>
At other times they are quiet and obedient, though when loaded or handled<lb/>
they make curious gurgling sounds in the throat. Geldi?igs are of course<lb/>
easier to manage than entire animals, and though it is said that they are<lb/>
deficient in stamina, they were proved to be very good workers in<lb/>
Somaliland.
</p>

<p>
Under fire they are less Hable to panic than other animals, and if made Under<lb/>
to kneel will remain so, perfectly quiet and contented. Breeds not fi^e.<lb/>
accustomed to Europeans are however timid on their approach, and it<lb/>
has been observed that the Somali camel is specially nervous and liable<lb/>
to panic at night.
</p>

<p>
Paift, if one may iudge by other animals, is borne by them with Pain.

<p>
unusual stoicism. They will struggle on without marked symptoms until<lb/>
quite exhausted by disease and privation, and on this account it is<lb/>
necessary to keep careful watch for the first signs of their being unwell, or<lb/>
they will continue quietly at work till beyond recovery.
</p>

<p>
Wiifit of ability to stand climatic chajige is the weak point of the camel,<lb/>
and on this account their selection must be careful and their diet strictly<lb/>
supervised till they are accustomed to it. In this connection too it<lb/>
should be noted that when taken to strange pasture they will sometimes<lb/>
refuse to eat at first, or on the other hand will consume poisonous plants<lb/>
as readily as any. Fresh grazing should therefore be well examined<lb/>
before animals are allowed to roam at will.
</p>

<p>
FEEDING CAMELS.
</p>

<p>
Feeding Feeding Ca?7iels. â Before stating the actual rations which camels
</p>

<p>
camels. should receive it will be well to consider the question of feeding generally,<lb/>
with special reference to service conditions. The camel is a herbivorous<lb/>
animal that gets its living by grazing and browsing on many thorny and<lb/>
hard plants found in its native locality, and thrives on such fare so well,<lb/>
that in many places he performs the work normally required by his<lb/>
owner without any supplementary rations. This is the case in Somaliland,<lb/>
and many districts of India and Africa. This being the case he must be<lb/>
treated under any circumstances like other herbivorous, cud-chewing<lb/>
animals as regards the general rules which should guide his feeding.<lb/>
These are : (i) A sufficient supply of fodder, or as much grazing and<lb/>
browsing as possible should be given him. (2) A sufficient period of quiet<lb/>
must be allowed daily for him to chew the cud. We may to a certain<lb/>
extent educate his inside to adapt its needs to our special requirements,<lb/>
but these two rules must be observed on service, or the animal's health<lb/>
suffers.
</p>

<p>
In regions where grazing is sparse and work is demanded, we find the<lb/>
owner supplements what the animal gets himself with a ration of grain.<lb/>
This is the case in Arabia and some parts of India and Africa. Leaving<lb/>
thirst out of the question, camels so fed prove better able to withstand<lb/>
hardship, and keep their condition better on service than those at graze<lb/>
only. The Indian and Arabian camels, for instance, proved stronger than<lb/>
the native animal in Somaliland, though the latter endured thirst<lb/>
better.
</p>

<p>
But in feeding grain of any sort, we must remember that it can easily<lb/>
be overdone, that the digestion cannot cope with large quantities, and that

<p>
under no conditions can it take the place of bulky food to any great<lb/>
extent. It must be given zÂ« additio7i to the ordinary amount of fodder,<lb/>
to compensate for the extra wear and tear demanded by extra work.<lb/>
These conditions are often hard to comply with on service, but they must<lb/>
be borne constantly in mind and put in force as far as possible. The<lb/>
camel can do several days' work without food, and except for his usual<lb/>
grumbhngs, do it uncomplainingly, but it taxes his constitution just as<lb/>
severely as it does that of other animals and renders him unfit for further<lb/>
exertion.
</p>

<p>
Native owners generally march slowly and allow the animal to pick<lb/>
up what he can on the way, and if this can be done it should be, but it is<lb/>
of course not always possible on service. Camels unused to grain should<lb/>
be hand fed to begin with and they soon become accustomed to it.

</p>

<p>
Grazinj
</p>

<p>
In the Somalila7id Expedition^ Indian and riding camels received their<lb/>
usual rations and hay, in lieu of other fodder, 20- lbs. Somali and<lb/>
Arabian camels received 4 lbs. of grain only (gram, barley or jowari) and<lb/>
fodder as above.
</p>

<p>
In Egypt " dhourra " is the grain usually given.
</p>

<p>
The foregoing are good rations and the outcome of experience. Grain,<lb/>
especially barley, should be crushed if possible ; with jowari and other<lb/>
millets however it is not so necessary, and cannot always be carried out.
</p>

<p>
Gram, oats, rice or other forage grains may be utilized if necessary and<lb/>
if judiciously fed, they are all useful. Beans were used in the Nile<lb/>
Expedition, but are said to have caused diarrhoea.
</p>

<p>
Gt-azing. â Whilst everyone agrees that camels require at least six<lb/>
hours' grazing daily, it appears to be equally certain that this is the<lb/>
hardest possible thing to get for them on service, even v/hen it is plentiful.<lb/>
Under military conditions, camels seldom get enough grazing, and they<lb/>
will not graze in the heat of the day in warm weather. This necessity for<lb/>
long hours of grazing does not of course apply where fodder can be<lb/>
supplied, but this of course is not possible on the march.
</p>

<p>
While, however, the military situation may not admit of six hours<lb/>
daily, this is the standard to be aimed at if condition is to be maintained.<lb/>
The plants that a camel eats are very numerous and vary in every<lb/>
district, many being of the most unlikely appearance and thorny to a<lb/>
degree, but if accustomed to them they are excellent feed.
</p>

<p>
Various Edible Plantsâ In Egypt.
</p>

<p>
Ghulain. Ghidain (Arabic, Saumiir\ the prevailing growth in the Handub
</p>

<p>
jungle, is a small scrub of green-gray colour. It grows to a height of<lb/>
two to three feet, has no leaves or thorns, and the smaller branches are<lb/>
covered with green specks.
</p>

<p>
Aus. Aus (Arabic, Shoosh\ a strong, jointed, knotty grass, of a dingy pale
</p>

<p>
green and in parts hay-like. Found in separate tufts three or four feet<lb/>
high.
</p>

<p>
Habow. Haboiv (Arabic, Haali laags), a moss-like, bulbous, ground
</p>

<p>
creeper, without thorns, found in the open, two or three inches high and<lb/>
also round the roots of Ghulain and Aus. Sprigs of green bulbs spring<lb/>
from a tough stem. It is juicy, aromatic and somewhat salt, found in<lb/>
considerable quantities and relished as a camel food.
</p>

<p>
Marokh. Marokh (Arabic, Aaqwaid)^ a broom-like, rushy plant, most plentiful
</p>

<p>
in the beds of dry streams.

THE CAMEL. 287
</p>

<p>
Palum-ba (Arabic, Ham bok/i), a delicate, pale green, juicy, thornless Palum-ba.<lb/>
plant, somewhat resembling the Jerusalem artichoke. Four to five feet<lb/>
high, with yellow, convolvulus-like flowers ; the leaves are about three<lb/>
inches wide, thin and delicate. The plant is not abundant, but is relished<lb/>
by camels, sheep and goats.
</p>

<p>
Siida ho (Arabic, El lubh)^ a small, hay-like grass, fairly abundant, Suda ho.<lb/>
dry and withered in the hot weather, but valuable after rain.
</p>

<p>
Mimosa creeper (Somali, Haarig^ haarig^ Arab. Baa naibh). A tree Mimosa<lb/>
creeper, like a convolvulus, often found on the mimosa tree, without creeper,<lb/>
flowers, but bright green leaves.
</p>

<p>
Wild caper (Somali, lubbi ogi^ Arab. Toon dhoop). A tough, thorny, Wild<lb/>
tangled, jungle growth, often found in immense wall-like masses. Of caper,<lb/>
green colour, very tough, and covered with sharp thorns ; it has pink<lb/>
flowers, and pink berries. The bush grows fifteen feet high and is met<lb/>
with pretty frequently. It is eaten with avidity.
</p>

<p>
Amaiteh (Arabic, Sainouth)^ resembles the English privet in every Amaneh.<lb/>
respect ; not abundant.
</p>

<p>
Mimosa (Egypt, Arabia, India). (Indian, Babul or Kikar^ Somali, Mimosa.<lb/>
Kora, Arabic, Naawaith). â This is a tree 20 feet high, and covered with<lb/>
formidable thorns, but the young branches are a favourite camel food<lb/>
wherever it is found, and it is most valuable grazing.
</p>

<p>
Hal/a, or alfa grass, a coarse desert grass which is found all over Haifa.<lb/>
Egypt, and is a good fodder.
</p>

<p>
In the Soudan, desert grasses known as " Sabas " and " Tress " are In the<lb/>
the chief food, and the leaves of gum trees (sunt), acacias, date, and Scudan.<lb/>
other palms are also eaten.
</p>

<p>
In the Sahara, " getaf " bushes, which have a salt taste, are much In the<lb/>
liked ; " irtem," a kind of pea ; " diel," a bush, which is only eaten when Sahara,<lb/>
less than i^ feet high ; and several grasses, of which " halfa " is one, are<lb/>
also consumed.
</p>

<p>
In Somaliland, many thorn-bushes, including species of mimosa. In Somali-<lb/>
afford grazing ; " dur," a long feathery grass growing in clumps 1^"^.<lb/>
six or eight feet high, is an excellent food for camels, and its young shoots<lb/>
for horses ; " daremo," a creeping grass like the Indian " dhub," "oryx,"<lb/>
a bluish grass ; and " durum," a short close-growing variety, are all<lb/>
good.
</p>

<p>
In India, the leaves of the " nim " and " pipal " trees, and the In India,<lb/>
twigs of the " babul " (mimosa) are said to be the best browsing, but<lb/>
at least fifty plants are utilised. The camel thorn (Suhtar khar) is<lb/>
collected in October and November in the Pishin valley, beaten up into<lb/>
bhoosa and stored for food. The hard kernels of the date fruit are

ground and given with the leaves. Saline plants which are collectively<lb/>
known as "lahna" shrubs, are favourite fodder in the districts where<lb/>
they occur. Bamboo, bir, holly oak, sugar cane, custard apple, tamarind,<lb/>
fig, mango, sheeshum, wild olives, and thistles are all eaten by camels.
</p>

<p>
It must be remembered that all camels will not eat every plant<lb/>
enumerated, but favour those only which are found in their own<lb/>
locahties ; if moved to another district they may take a little while to<lb/>
become accustomed to the change of fodder.
</p>

<p>
Poisonous plants. â The "Oleander" (Kenar) a large handsome<lb/>
shrub, with lanceolate leaves, and bunches of white, yellow, or pink<lb/>
blossoms, is common all over India, and poisonous for horses and<lb/>
camels. Hill camels coming to the plains are most likely to suffer.
</p>

<p>
It produces symptoms of drowsiness, vomiting, and subsequently<lb/>
unconsciousness and death in eight hours to two days.
</p>

<p>
Stimulants of any sort, in full quantity, are good treatment, and a<lb/>
purge should be given at once.
</p>

<p>
Several poisonous plants are found in Somaliland. " /r^/Â«," a bush<lb/>
eight to ten feet high, with bunches of light green, candle-like stems<lb/>
radiating from a common centre, is quickly fatal to camels. Ponies do<lb/>
not eat it.
</p>

<p>
" Moh" a bush with small yellow berries ; " lVal?aro" from which the<lb/>
local arrow poison is obtained ; ^^ Boa," a vivid green plant exuding a<lb/>
milky sap ; and " Haroo7i" are all said to be poisonous.
</p>

<p>
The Adthai tree (Arabic Rukh), found in Somaliland, produces violent<lb/>
diarrhoea in ;inimals freshly imported.
</p>

<p>
Greefi food of any description is welcome to the camel. All green<lb/>
grain crops, the pea and bean tribe, and clovers, are eaten with avidity ;<lb/>
and if the animals have been on dry food only, or are hungry, they<lb/>
should not be allowed to gorge themselves on first entering a field of<lb/>
succulent fodder. They generally overeat themselves under these<lb/>
circumstances, and may suffer from flatulent colic, which may prove fatal ;<lb/>
their grazing on such food should be limited to begin with.
</p>

<p>
" /)V^/?j"cz," z&amp;gt;, broken straw, is fed to camels when grazing or other<lb/>
fodder is not to be procured, and may, with advantage, be mixed with<lb/>
their grain rations to ensure thorough mastication. " Missa Bhoosa " is<lb/>
the most suitable variety, but it is not so digestible as the previously<lb/>
described plants or hay.
</p>

<p>
Method of fecdi?ii^.â On the completion of the march, or morning<lb/>
portion of it, the animals should be grazed till afternoon, and fed with<lb/>
grain in the evening after being brought back to camp. In addition,<lb/>
whatever fodder has been collected for them is given after the grain food,

and they are left in peace for the night. In very hot weather they do<lb/>
not graze during the hotte:.t part of the day, but should be left<lb/>
un iisturbed on the grazing ground, where they will seek what shelter<lb/>
is to be had, and chew the cud.
</p>

<p>
Watering.
</p>

<p>
Waiiring.âln this matter we are confronted with the traditional Watering,<lb/>
idea that camels require watering at very infrequent intervals, and that<lb/>
it is indeed a good thing to accustom them to go without water for long<lb/>
periods. This belief rests on some foundation of fact, in that i\\i camel<lb/>
can, and in some regions has to, go without water for several days on<lb/>
end. Some can subsist and work for as long as ten days in this manner,<lb/>
and Somali camels, which are most tolerant in this partxular, are said to<lb/>
have gone even longer. This ability to go without water is a feature<lb/>
which the camel has in common with some other ruminants, but<lb/>
it cannot be argued from this that, under the conditions of war<lb/>
which we impose on the animal, infrequent watering should be made a<lb/>
rule. As a matter of fact, the more work you ask the camel to do the more<lb/>
water he requires. The conditions of service are totally different to, and<lb/>
much harder than, the normal work of the animal. The loads are,<lb/>
generally speaking, heavy, the marches long and often hurried, the<lb/>
opportunities for rest and grazing limited, and the general wear and tear<lb/>
increased. Under the circumstances, the baggage camel requires more<lb/>
water and more frequent watering on service than at any time.
</p>

<p>
Different breeds of camels vary widely as to their requirements,<lb/>
and in their capability of enduring thirst. The big Delta camel of<lb/>
Egypt requires a copious drink every day, whereas the Somali camel<lb/>
does very well if he finds water every fourth day, and the question of<lb/>
selecting animals for the work in hand is again a consideration.
</p>

<p>
It has been said that if a desert camel is frequently watered he loses<lb/>
his power of abstinence for lon,-,-^ periods. This power has now been<lb/>
acquired by generations of training, and might be lost in the same way,<lb/>
but the conditions under which we use the camel are those which<lb/>
demand harder work than he has ever previously performed with<lb/>
probably less food, and certainly less rest than he is accustomed to.<lb/>
Under these conditions, even the native owner waters him frequently,<lb/>
and on service that is the rule to follow.
</p>

<p>
Camels should be watered every day on service, if water is to<lb/>
be had.

<p>
ANIMAL MANAGEMENT.
</p>

<p>
Egyptian delta and river camels must be watered daily.
</p>

<p>
Indian camels will do well enough if watered every other day.
</p>

<p>
Arab and desert camels will go two or three days.
</p>

<p>
Somali camels will not die if watered once every four days ; but it is<lb/>
better to make the rule to water daily, if water can be got. With green<lb/>
grazing much less water is required than when dry food is given.
</p>

<p>
After long abstinence it is not wise to let camels fill themselves<lb/>
hurriedly ; it is better to give a very moderate quantity at first, and<lb/>
subsequently allow them to drink as much as they will. After four or<lb/>
five days' abstinence in hot weather they may drink as much as twenty<lb/>
gallons.
</p>

<p>
Camels prefer still to running water, and should be watered while the<lb/>
sun is up and the water warm. It is usual to water them in the<lb/>
afternoon on their way back from grazing, and before they receive their<lb/>
grain food. On the march camels are not usually allowed to drink at<lb/>
wayside streams, and though this is contrary to the rules for other<lb/>
animals, it appears to be the outcome of experience. If, however, it is<lb/>
known that no water is procurable at the halting place, the rule should,<lb/>
of course, be broken.
</p>

<p>
Marching with Camels.
</p>

<p>
Marching
</p>

<p>
with
</p>

<p>
camels.
</p>

<p>
Marching with cainels. â The considerations to be borne in mind<lb/>
are : â The animals should not work more than eight hours a day.
</p>

<p>
They should be allowed to graze from 8 or 9 a.m. till 4 or 5 p.m.
</p>

<p>
The personnel must get sufficient rest at night.
</p>

<p>
With marches of not more than 15 miles, the whole may be done at<lb/>
once ; but if 20 miles is demanded, it is better to do 15 in the morning<lb/>
and 5 in the evening.
</p>

<p>
When the ground is suitable, z.^., free from ditches (nullahs), and<lb/>
there is a moon, camels march well at night, and night marching has the<lb/>
advantage of being cool and allowing them plenty of daylight for grazing.<lb/>
On the other hand, if the road is difficult and the night dark, night<lb/>
marching is not advisable, and a start should be made at dawn.
</p>

<p>
The pace of baggage camels under favourable conditions is i\ miles<lb/>
an hour ; it may perhaps occasionally exceed this a trifle, but under any<lb/>
circumstances, it is bad policy to hurry, as it quickly wears them out.<lb/>
A start should be made at 2 or 3 a.m. ; the morning march concluded<lb/>
before 9 a.m., and the balance, if any, done after 4 p.m. More than<lb/>
twenty miles a day cannot be e.xpected as a rule either from men or<lb/>
animals.

THE CAMEL. 291
</p>

<p>
kiding camels will carry 250 lbs. thirty miles daily for long periods,<lb/>
their best pace being a "jog" of five to six miles an hour.
</p>

<p>
The loads should not be adjusted till just before starting, six hours Tlie loadb<lb/>
being, generally speaking, a sufficient time for the animals to bear their<lb/>
burden at a stretch.
</p>

<p>
A halt of ten minutes should be made once during a march of over A halt,<lb/>
ten miles to allow the animals to urinate. This act in the male<lb/>
camel is accomplished very slovvly, the urine being ejected backwards,<lb/>
in a very thin stream, for several minutes at a time.
</p>

<p>
Camels are generally tied by their nose ropes to their fellows in front,<lb/>
in strings of three. They should be untied at steep or difficult places, to<lb/>
prevent the chance of these ropes pulling on and perhaps lacerating the<lb/>
nose.
</p>

<p>
If there is no hurry and the country permits, it is better to march<lb/>
them loose, on a broad front, and allow them to graze as they go ; but<lb/>
the plan is seldom feasible on military expeditions.
</p>

<p>
Crossing ditcJies. â Unless able to stride across, a ditch presents a Cross'ng<lb/>
serious obstacle to the camel, and where steep sided, narrow nullahs are ditches,<lb/>
frequent, portable bridges have been carried to facilitate crossing. These<lb/>
consist of two or three stout planks, with battens, forming a platform<lb/>
about three feet wide and eight to ten feet long. The weight they have<lb/>
to bear, i.e.^ the loaded camel, is 1,500 to 1,600 lbs. They were found<lb/>
nece:,sary in Afghanistan.
</p>

<p>
Crossing 7'ivers. â If the stream is not very swift, the camel can ford Crossing<lb/>
to a depth of four feet, and is secure on a shifting sandy bottom, which rivers,<lb/>
his passage renders firmer and more fitted for other animals.
</p>

<p>
If obliged, he is a good, strong swimmer, but will not enter the<lb/>
water unless compelled. When out of his depth, only the head is above<lb/>
water, and if not interfered with, he can swim a considerable distance, and<lb/>
has been seen to cross the Nile at Wady Haifa, where the stream is very<lb/>
broad, and the current powerrul.
</p>

<p>
Management during halts and in camp. â On arrival at camp the Manage-<lb/>
loads are taken off and the animals sent to graze. There is a consensus ment<lb/>
of opinion that the back should be protected from the sun until it has during<lb/>
cooled down, and with this in view, the saddles are very generally left on. }^ ^^ ^<lb/>
The camel suffers from cold at night, and unless blankets are provided,<lb/>
the saddles are still kept on during the night. This system is a fruitful<lb/>
cause of sore backs. The skin never gets a chance to recover its tone-, it<lb/>
always has some weight on it, and suffers in consequence.
</p>

<p>
The saddle must be taken off for some considerable period daily,<lb/>
if the back is to be kept free from pressure galls. If the weather is cold<lb/>

nt night and no other covering is provided, then it must be left off in the<lb/>
day and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
The back should be rubbed to keep the hair from matting, and<lb/>
retaining dust and mud. Further grooming is not practicable on<lb/>
service.
</p>

<p>
A daily inspection of the stripped back should be carried out, before<lb/>
the animals go to graze.
</p>

<p>
In hot weather, clipping is advisable if it can be carried out ; it<lb/>
materially assists in maintaining condition and preventing exhaustion.
</p>

<p>
On returning from graze, or on completion of the evening march, the<lb/>
whole of the grain feed should be given. Feeding from nosebags<lb/>
prevents waste, and animals soon become accustomed to it. Failing this.

and sometimes get fatal colic and stomach staggers as a consequence.
</p>

<p>
The haliiJii!^ place should be ( hosen where the ground is level and<lb/>
clean. Hard sand is suitable. Any stones likely to interfere with the<lb/>
animals resting comfortably, or damage their breast pads, must be<lb/>
removed.
</p>

<p>
llie formaiio7i may be in lines, with sufficient space between them<lb/>

htspectipn of the Grazing Ground.
</p>

<p>
An officer should invariably visit the grazing ground and see that the Inspection<lb/>
animals are properly distributed, so that each gets good opportunity to of the<lb/>
graze, and also to see that none are off feed. If not inspected, attendants grazing<lb/>
have a habit of tying their charges to trees to prevent them straying, and g''0""d-<lb/>
not troubling about them further.
</p>

<p>
Equipme?it. â Tlie equipment of baggage camels is a saddle with girth Equip-<lb/>
crupper and breast piece, a nose peg and rope and loading ropes. In ment.<lb/>
addition, a head stall, a blanket, and loading nets are sometimes<lb/>
provided.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Fig. 58.
</p>

<p>
Saddle. â Camels' saddles are of various local patterns, but the Indian Saddle,<lb/>
(palan) is generally considered the best. It consists of two wooden<lb/>
arches, joined together by a wooden peg (kokra) which admits of their<lb/>
being opened and closed as required (fig. 58). The arch should be<lb/>
well clear of the top of the withers, and rounded to the curve of<lb/>
the back.
</p>

<p>
The side bars are four springy bamboos lashed to the arches on each<lb/>
side, the centre bar of the lower three passing through a flap of the outer<lb/>
cover of the pad. The upper bar is lashed just below the kokra, and is<lb/>
six to eight inches longer than the others each way. (Fig. 57.)
</p>

<p>
The pad is covered with goat hair cloth and lined with blanket, which The pad.<lb/>

back.
</p>

<p>
Great care must be taken that the seam joining the lining and outer<lb/>
cover does not come in contact with the back.
</p>

<p>
The rear point of the pad (khoote) should be ten or twelve inches<lb/>
above the level of the back and eight inches above the level of the<lb/>
central opening ; it should be firmly stuffed and strongly sewn, as its<lb/>
object is to prevent the load shifting backwards and forwards on the<lb/>
saddle.
</p>

<p>
In no case must the pad be so long as to bear on the loins, or a bad<lb/>
gall of this part is inevitable.
</p>

<p>
It is essential that each camel should have its own saddle and that<lb/>
the stuffing of this be altered from time to time, in order to conform to<lb/>
alterations in the shape of the back, or relieve pressure from parts which<lb/>
show signs of undue wear. Nothing but constant attention to this matter<lb/>
will avoid undue loss from sore backs.<lb/>

dragged out ; but a lazy camel will hang back and pull the saddle of the<lb/>

<p>
THE OX.
</p>

<p>
Oxen are employed as pack or draught transport animals in many<lb/>
parts of the world; as pack animals we have employed them in Abyssinia,<lb/>
and many Indian expeditions, and in draught they are largely used in<lb/>
South Africa, and form the chief animal transport of India. They are<lb/>
generally more suited for line of communication transport than for<lb/>
employment at the front, and are by no means such good pack animals<lb/>
f^s mules, but that they may be successfully used for pack work in difficult

country is shown by the tea caravans which come over the vShan hills in<lb/>
Burma. The oxen employed are small, the loads are not heavy, and<lb/>
perfectly balanced. The saddles are kept in place by a crupper and<lb/>
iDreast-piece only, no girth being used, and, so equipped, the steepest and<lb/>
roughest of mountain paths are successfully surmounted.
</p>

<p>
/Â« South Africa, the " trek" ox is used in draught, though the natives In South<lb/>
also employ them as pack animals. They are yoked in pairs, and sixteen Africa,<lb/>
constitute an ordinary " span " for a waggon.
</p>

<p>
In the Zulu War it was found that if allowed ample time to graze,<lb/>
and judiciously worked, they could cover from 15 to 20 miles a day,<lb/>
day after day, without knocking up. The manner in which they drew<lb/>
heavy loads over rough ground, across rivers and drifts, up steep and<lb/>
long hills, on roads impracticable for English draught horses, was<lb/>
marvellous.
</p>

<p>
Selection of oxen. â In selecting oxen for transport work, it should be Selection<lb/>
borne in mind that they live and thrive best if worked in or near the of oxen,<lb/>
localities in which they are bred. If possible, up-country oxen should<lb/>
not be worked on the coast line, as it is found that the change of climate<lb/>
and grass produces loss of condition and disease. None but trained oxen<lb/>
should be employed, and they should not be put to work before they are<lb/>
four or five years old.
</p>

<p>
Aoe up to %vhich they are serviceable.â T\\^ age up to which they are Age up<lb/>
serviceable depends on the care and attention they receive, and the ^Â° which<lb/>
quality of the grass on which they are grazed. In localities where the gg^Jj^g.^<lb/>
grass is good they will work until they are sixteen or seventeen years old ; ^^jg^<lb/>
if the grass is of indifferent quality, until they are eleven or twelve years<lb/>
old.
</p>

<p>
Pace and hours of work. â They can travel at the rate of 2 to 2^ miles Pace and<lb/>
an hour, and can work for seven or eight hours a day. In the winter hours of<lb/>
months, owing to the grass being scanty and deficient in nutriment, oxen ^"^^^ *<lb/>
are not able to perform so much work as in summer. Generally speaking,<lb/>
winter grass is only sufficient to keep the oxen alive, not to work on.<lb/>
It becomes poor about the latter end of June, and often in the first half<lb/>
of that month ; and such was found to be the case along the line of<lb/>
march in Zululand. Cattle fall off in condition from the beginning of<lb/>
July until the spring grass is growing in September. This remark applies<lb/>
generally to cattle fed on grass, and not to transport oxen only.
</p>

</p>

<p>
influences, it is incumbent when this process is taking place that the<lb/>
work should be reduced, and measures taken to prevent exposure to wind<lb/>
and rain.
</p>

<p>
Ifitolerajtce of wet with cold weather. â Bovine tolerance of wet with<lb/>
cold weather is small, and if oxen are exposed to it when in low condition<lb/>
they die off rapidly, and in great numbers. When wet weather prevails, it<lb/>
is advisable to knock off work altogether, and turn the oxen into bush or<lb/>
sheltered ground.
</p>

<p>
Sore necks. â Another cogent reason why oxen should not be worked<lb/>
in wet weather is that the yoke causes " sore necks " from the increased<lb/>
friction of the wet yoke on the skin. The part of the neck on which<lb/>
the yoke bears becomes excoriated, and the skin tender and tumefied.
</p>

<p>
In the way of prevention, that part of the yoke, and the skin on<lb/>
which it bears, should in rainy weather be well oiled or greased, so long<lb/>
as the oxen are working.
</p>

<p>
Watering. â Oxen should be watered at least three times a day in<lb/>
summer and twice a day in winter.
</p>

<p>
System of trekking practised by transport riders. â Transport riders<lb/>
when engaged on private business, generally travel at night. As a rule<lb/>
they inspan at sundown, work four hours, then outspan for four<lb/>
hours, and then inspan until sunrise. By this system of trekking the<lb/>
work is done during the night, when it is cool, and the oxen have the<lb/>
whole of the day to rest and graze. This sensible method could not,<lb/>
however, be carried out in time of war ; nevertheless, a modified form of<lb/>
it could be practised on the lines of communication, and in those parts<lb/>
of the country where there was no danger of being attacked by an<lb/>
enemy. Oxen should not be inspanned for more than fours hours<lb/>
consecutively.
</p>

<p>
Selection of camping grounds in cold weather. â When camping for<lb/>
the night, advantage should be taken of rises in the ground to shelter the<lb/>
animals from cold winds, hail and rain. In Zululand, there is often<lb/>
excessive cold and rain on high mountains, while it is comparatively warm<lb/>
and fine somewhat lower down.
</p>

<p>
The fact that oxen are slow in recovering from low condition, that<lb/>
when in this state their draught power is reduced by one-half, and that<lb/>
cold wet vÂ»-eather kills them off like flies, should be ever present in the<lb/>
minds of the officers in charge.
</p>

<p>
Outspantiing in ivintcr. â When " trekking " in winter, oxen should be<lb/>
'' outspanned " near rivers, brook, spruits, low-lying ground, or bush<lb/>
country, as in these places grass is more abundant, and of a more<lb/>
nutritious character.

THE OX.
</p>

<p>
297
</p>

<p>
Spare oxett. â It is advisable to have two spare oxen with each span, Spare<lb/>
to replace the sick or lame. A sick or lame ox should be removed from oxen,<lb/>
the span at once, as he does not represent any draught power, is in fact<lb/>
" a passenger," and has to be dragged along by the others.
</p>

<p>
Time required for grazing. â Oxen should be allowed to graze at Time<lb/>
least six hours a day ; this, unless the grass is good and plentiful, is required<lb/>
insufficient. When practicable, oxen should be grazed an hour before gj-^^ine<lb/>
starting in the morning ; this would enable them to ruminate (chew the ^'<lb/>
cud) en route.
</p>

<p>
In India the draught ox is worked in pairs, yoked to small carts. In India.<lb/>
They are rarely harnessed in teams of more than four, and that is<lb/>
exceptional, and as the roads are hard and good, they have to be<lb/>
shod. They are employed in Government service, for drawing siege<lb/>
guns and as draught and pack transport. Siege train bullocks are<lb/>
specially large, powerful specimens bred for the purpose, and for this<lb/>
work they are eminently suited, as they stand fire well.
</p>

Selectio7i and age. â In India bullocks purchased by Government are Selection<lb/>

</p>

<p>
The neck must be examined for yoke galls or swellings, which are<lb/>
often so severe as to incapacitate the animal altogether.<lb/>
Age. y4,i^e. â Bullocks for both siege train and transport are purchased
</p>

<p>
between four and six years of age.
</p>

<p>
The age is told by the incisor teeth and by the rings on the horns.<lb/>
The upper jaw presents no incisor teeth, but a firm smooth gum, whilst<lb/>
in the lower jaw there are eight incisors, which are naturally somewhat<lb/>
loosely fixed in the gum.
</p>

<p>
The whole of the milk teeth may be seen in the mouth of the<lb/>
calf at or shortly after birth, and no change, except such as is due to<lb/>
growth, wear and tear, takes place till the animal is eighteen or twenty<lb/>
months old.
</p>

<p>
At this time the central pair of milk teeth drop out and are replaced<lb/>
by the first pair of permanent (broad) teeth.
</p>

<p>
The second and third pairs follow rapidly, but the fourth may not be<lb/>
cut till the animal is nearly four years old.
</p>

<p>
At first the teeth present broad sharp white edges, and are close<lb/>
together, but as they get worn they show a flat yellow top and get<lb/>
gradually rounder and more separated from each other.
</p>

<p>
A five-year old ox will have all his teeth in wear, but while the centre<lb/>
pair show a well-marked flattened table, the corners have only got their<lb/>
edges slightly worn away.
</p>

<p>
The age may also be told by counting the rings at the base of the<lb/>
horn and adding two.
</p>

<p>
This is a simple method with young cattle, but it need hardly be<lb/>
pointed out that cattle dealers all the world over take care that the<lb/>
horns do not show a large number of rings when they offer cattle for<lb/>
sale.<lb/>
Feeding. Feeding. â ^The digestive apparatus of the ox is in the main like that
</p>

<p>
of the camel previously described. There are no " water sacs " attached<lb/>
to the paunch, the second stomach is of simpler pattern and the third<lb/>
more distinctly divided from the fourth.
</p>

<p>
The paunch occupies the largest portion of the belly, and, leaving<lb/>
out all unnecessary details, the question of feeding the ox on service<lb/>
resolves itself into giving him sufficient bulky fodder to fill the paunch<lb/>
and allowing him time to chew the cud subsequently. Inability to<lb/>
comply with these requirements, means rapid wastage of ox transport,<lb/>
and nothing will stop it.
</p>

<p>
Grain feeding is the rule in India, in addition to bulky fodder, but<lb/>
although it adds to the working power and stamina, it cannot compensate<lb/>
for loss of bulk in the ration. On service, of course it must often be

a choice in the mind of the commander, whether he will push on at<lb/>
the risk of sacrifice or not, and, although the military situation may<lb/>
require it, it should be quite understood that ruminants cannot stand<lb/>
being hurried on in the same manner that horses and mules can.<lb/>
Their digestive arrangements will not permit it, and certain loss must<lb/>
follow.
</p>

<p>
For this reason, as previously stated, oxen are better kept on lines<lb/>
of communication, wheie it ma)' be possible to carry out the wo'k under<lb/>
conditions suitable to them.

Shoeing.
</p>

<p>
In South Africa it is not the custom to give grain, and under these<lb/>
circumstances more time for grazing must of course be allowed.
</p>

<p>
Fodder. â Oxen will eat and relish a coarser class of grass and fodder<lb/>
than horses, and all grasses, straws and stems of standing crops may<lb/>
be given.
</p>

<p>
If animals are suddenly brought from a dry to a green ration, they<lb/>
should not be allowed to gorge themselves at first or they get flatulent<lb/>
colic (blown : hoven), but if possible some dry food should at first be<lb/>
mixed with the green.
</p>

<p>
Bhi'isa is excellent feed, and if sufficient is procurable nothing else<lb/>
is required.
</p>

<p>
Watering. â Oxen should be watered two or three times daily,<lb/>
according to the temperature of the day. They should be allowed to<lb/>
drink on the march whenever opportunity occurs
</p>

<p>
Marching with oxen.â ThQ pace of ox transport is, as previously<lb/>
stated, 2 to 2h miles an hour, and if not over-driven they will travel<lb/>
fifteen to twenty or even twenty-four miles daily under favourable<lb/>
conditions. The pace and distance covered with oxen depends not<lb/>
only on the weather, but to a considerable extent on the drivers, as the<lb/>
animals can only be induced to work well by those who thoroughly<lb/>
understand their peculiarities and to whom they are accustomed. As a<lb/>
rule, they are very timid of strangers, and become dangerous or stampede<lb/>
if approached by white men when they are only accustomed to natives.
</p>

<p>
They should not be worked when the sun is hot, and for this reason<lb/>
marching in the late evening and early morning is to be advocated. In<lb/>
India, however, where they are used to heat, they can very often be<lb/>
worked all day, or during great part of it Up hills they are generally<lb/>
good pullers if not over-taxed, but if they lose heart, they become<lb/>
obstinate, and lie down. As yoked animals have little or no control over<lb/>
carts going dow^n hill, an efficient brake is always necessary.
</p>

<p>
During halts, if not grazing, and at night, the anima's may be tied to<lb/>
the yoke bar, as they give no trouble and will remain quietly chewing the<lb/>
cud till required.
</p>

<p>
Pack bullocks are driven in droves ; they are apt to straggle in search<lb/>
of fodder, but under skilful management move at about two miles an hour,<lb/>
carrying i6o pounds. They may be secured to a picket rope, by a neck<lb/>
rope being fastened alternately on each side.
</p>

<p>
Crossi)ig rivers. â The ox is a good swimmer, takes the water readily,<lb/>
and can ford comparatively deep streams against strong currents.
</p>

<p>
Shoeing. â In India where working oxen have to travel made roads they<lb/>
are shod. The shoes are flat pieces of iron shaped to each claw, and

have a stay turned up at the toe so that it rests against the inside of the<lb/>
claw and prevents the shoe moving, and small, rose-headed nails are used<lb/>
to secure it. The animal is cast for the operation as follows : â A rope is<lb/>
put round the horns, passed back to the wither, where a turn is taken<lb/>
round the girth, then passed to the loins, where another turn is passed<lb/>
round the belly. The rope is gradually pulled tight, and the bullock sinks<lb/>
quietly down. The feet are then tied together and propped at a<lb/>
convenient height for the smith.

CHAPTER XL
</p>

<p>
PREVENTION AND FIRST AID TREATMENT OF<lb/>
DISEASE.
</p>

<p>
On service the majority of casualties among animals come under the<lb/>
following headings : â
</p>

<p>
Contagious diseases ; Loss or want of condition and exhaustion ;<lb/>
CoHc, and wounds and injuries.
</p>

<p>
Loss or want of condition, combined with injuries, usually account<lb/>
for the bulk of the losses, and these may be regarded as preventable.<lb/>
Contagious diseases are also to an extent preventable, and their spread<lb/>
may in any case be greatly checked by simple precautions. The best<lb/>
means of prevention, generally speaking, is a thorough knowledge of the<lb/>
management of animals in he.dth. Whilst the animal is fit and in<lb/>
condition hardship and exertion can be borne without injury, but once the<lb/>
troop horse is sick, injured or exhausted, he is only an encumbrance to a<lb/>
fighting unit and has to be left behind, his place being filled by a fresh<lb/>
animal, possibly not in hard condition. It is on this account that so<lb/>
mu:h stress is laid on the necessity for thorough knowledge of stable<lb/>
management, feeding and work under all circumstances, and to the<lb/>
importance of drecting attention to the prevention of injuries rather than<lb/>
to the treatment of those that have occurred. Sufficient knowledge to<lb/>
deal with injuries and emergent cases in a common sense manner, until<lb/>
professional assistance is obtainable, is an excellent addition ro the<lb/>
mounted soldier's education ; but these occurrences will be comparatively<lb/>
few and far between if horses and other animals are got and kept<lb/>
thoroughly fit. For use in such cases as can be treated in the lines units<lb/>
are provided on service with a small field veterinary chest, the contents<lb/>
of which and directions for their use are here appended : â

<p>
ANIMAL MANAGEMENT.
</p>

<p>
The Appearances of Health.
</p>

<p>
The appearance of the horse i?t health. â The fore feet are always<lb/>
square and firm on the ground, but one of the hind feet may be rested on<lb/>
the toe. It is noteworthy that the horse never rests a foreleg unless<lb/>
there is something the matter with it. The head is always on the alert,<lb/>
eyes wide open and ears pricking to and fro. The coat shines and the<lb/>
skin may be rolled about on the muscles beneath, being loose and supple.<lb/>
The pulse is about 40 ; the breathing about 15 to the minute ; the<lb/>
temperature 100 ; the colour of the lining of the eye and nostril is salmon<lb/>
pink. The bowels are moved frequently, on an average eight times in<lb/>
24 hours, and the " droppings " are usually just soft enough to split as<lb/>
they fall on the ground. They should not be coated with slime, and<lb/>
their colour varies from golden yellow to dark green, according to the<lb/>
nature of food. The urine is passed several times daily, in quantities of<lb/>
a quart or more, and is rather thick in appearance and light yellow in<lb/>
colour. Both horse and mare, when urinating, straddle, grunt and<lb/>
assume a very awkward position, with the skin on the quarters wrinkled,<lb/>
which should not be mistaken for pain. In the mule the droppings are<lb/>
smaller, harder, and darker in colour, and the breathing will in all cases<lb/>
be faster in the smaller sized animals.
</p>

<p>
Appearaiices of health m the cajnei. â The head is erect, ears pricked<lb/>
and eye wide open, except when chewing the cud, when it may be<lb/>
temporarily closed, or nearly so ; the skin free from scurf or thickening<lb/>
about the bends of joints ; the flank full and showing no hollow, and the<lb/>
hump plump and not leaning much to one side. The pulse and breathing<lb/>
are difficult to take and not very trustworthy, and the temperature is<lb/>
about 99. The droppings are in small hard balls, and are passed without<lb/>
effort ; the urine is clear and voided backwards by both sexes, the act in<lb/>
the male occupying a considerable time.
</p>

<p>
Appearajices of health in the ox. â Constant leisurely chewing of cud<lb/>
when at rest, muzzle moist, skin loose and supple and the hair licked up<lb/>
in places. The animal consorts with its fellows in Ihe herd ; if sick, the<lb/>
ox frequently sepirates itself from others. The pulse about 50 ;<lb/>
temperature loi â 102 ; breathing 15â20. The bowels are frequently<lb/>
moved, and the droppings are naturally soft. The urine is clear and can<lb/>
be voided by the male without stopping for the purpose.
</p>

<p>
Temperature. â The temperature is most conveniently taken at the<lb/>
anus. It varies slightly during the 24 hours, being higher at midday
</p>

<p>
and evening than it is during night and early morning. Immediately<lb/>
after work, and especially in a hot sun, the temperature of healthy<lb/>
animals may rise, but as a rule it is unaffected by climatic conditions,<lb/>
and it is thus a most valuable guide. The thermometer should be<lb/>
observed before introduction into the bowel to make sure that it is below<lb/>
the normal temperature of the animal, wetted or oiled to make its<lb/>
passage easy, kept in a sufficient time to register accurately (three<lb/>
minutes is ample for the slowest thermometers) and cleaned in cold<lb/>
water. Before putting it away shake the mercury down again below<lb/>
the normal temperature. A rise of temperature often precedes any<lb/>
visible symptoms in contagious diseases, and so is important in weeding<lb/>
out "suspected" animals.
</p>

<p>
Breathing. â The breathing may be most conveniently noted by the Breathing.<lb/>
rise and fall of the flank, the movement of the nostrils, or on a cold<lb/>
morning by the steamy expiration of the breath. It should be counted<lb/>
when the animal is first approached, as excitement, fright or movement<lb/>
cause an increase in the number of the respirations. Breathing is<lb/>
usually noiseless, and any sounds made during it deserve attention<lb/>
as they indicate that the lungs or throat are affected. The rise and fall of<lb/>
the flank is steady and gradual, but in broken-winded animals there is a<lb/>
double effort to expire the air from the chest.
</p>

<p>
Pulse. â The pulse may be easiest felt beneath the lower jaw of the Pulse.<lb/>
horse and mule ; inside the arm or at the back of the fetlock of the ox ;<lb/>
by the heart beats of the camel. The animal should be at perfect rest<lb/>
when it is taken, as exercise and excitement quicken it. In illness the<lb/>
pulse is usually faster than normal, and its character varies considerably,<lb/>
the two most important differences which it is necessary to note being<lb/>
whether it is stronger or weaker than it should be.
</p>

<p>
The colour of the lining of the eye., ?iose a?td mouth indicate the The colour<lb/>
state of the blood, as in these situations the covering over the blood- 0/ the<lb/>
vessels is so thin that the condition of the circulation may be judged by 'j"'"g of<lb/>
observing them. Normally, they are of a salmon pink colour, and f^^e J^J^^^^^^',<lb/>
from spots or discharges, but during illness they may become a darker mouth.<lb/>
red (congested), paler (from loss of blood), or yellowish (bilious).
</p>

<p>
The skill should be supple in all animals, free from scurf and rolling The skin,<lb/>
easily on the structures beneath, and the hair of the coat should lie<lb/>
evenly, feel smooth, and carry a gloss. In disease it may be "hide-<lb/>
bound," or feel as if it were stuck firmly on the muscles below ; " scurfy,"<lb/>
from want of attention or sometimes from mange ; and the coat may be<lb/>
" dull " in appearance, " harsh " to the feel, or " staring," that is, having<lb/>
the hair on end instead of lying flat.

3o6 ANIMAL MANAGEMENT.
</p>

<p>
Nursing. Niirsmg is attention to every detail which conduces to the comfort or
</p>

<p>
benefit of the patient. The chief points to be noted are : â
</p>

<p>
1. Ventilation (in buildings), which is plenty of fresh air and no
</p>

<p>
draughts. Horses and other animals do not require to be kept<lb/>
in a warm atmosphere, but they do, better if extremes of tempera-<lb/>
ture can be avoided during the 24 hours. Standing in the open<lb/>
as animals do on service, they should be sheltered as far as<lb/>
possible from high winds, but as a rule cases of illness make<lb/>
good progress in the open air, unless the weather is bad.
</p>

<p>
2. Clothing should be sufficient for warmth, but not so heavy as to be
</p>

<p>
a burden to weak animals or make them sweat. Body rollers<lb/>
should not be drawn tight enough to impede the movements of<lb/>
the chest in breathing.<lb/>
Bandages should be applied to the legs from below the knee to<lb/>
the coronet to keep up the warmth of the limbs. They should<lb/>
not be too tight or they will impede the circulation, and if<lb/>
procurable, they should be woollen. Hay or straw bands or<lb/>
strips of blanket or sacking may be utilized on emergency, or if<lb/>
linen bandages are to be had, tow, cotton wool, hay or straw<lb/>
may be loosely bound round the legs.
</p>

<p>
Bandag- Baitdaging. â Don't draw any one portion of the bandage tighter
</p>

<p>
ing- than another ; don't tie the strings tighter than the bandage is
</p>

<p>
put on ; fasten the strings at the outside of the leg. In bandaging<lb/>
uneven surfaces (such as the hock and knee) or swollen surfaces,<lb/>
be careful to put plenty of wool, tow or any soft padding under<lb/>
the bandage, and do not draw it tight. In bandaging wounds<lb/>
which have a hanging lip of skin, be careful to commence from<lb/>
below, so that the lip is brought into its natural position. Do<lb/>
not bandage wounds of joints at all tightly. For hot bandages use<lb/>
flannel or blanket ; for cold bandages use thin doosuti or linen.
</p>

<p>
3. Bedding, when obtainable, should always be used for the sick
</p>

<p>
unless they are camped on loose sand, when it can be dispensed<lb/>
with. Horses will take rest, especially when sick, if their bed is<lb/>
level and soft, but will not lie long or often unless this is attended<lb/>
to. In all cases it should be kept dry and free from smell.<lb/>
Food. 4. Food. â Animals which are likely to be at work again within a
</p>

<p>
short time should be kept on a plentiful ration, so that they<lb/>
return strong and fit, care being always taken not to allow their<lb/>
bowels to become constipated. Cases likely to remain in

</p>

<p>
hospital for a considerable period must have their grain ration<lb/>
reduced, but should receive compensation in an extra allowance<lb/>
of bran.
</p>

<p>
Sick horses and others which do not feed freely require coaxing to<lb/>
eat. They should be fed in small quantities and often, as many changes<lb/>
of food as can be secured should be offered to them, especially varieties<lb/>
of green food, which are not only tempting to the animal but serve to<lb/>
keep the bowels in order. With weak animals care should be taken that<lb/>
the feeds are placed within easy reach so that feeding entails no exertion,<lb/>
and several varieties of food may be left with the animal during the<lb/>
night, as they will often feed when everything is quiet. Water should be<lb/>
kept constantly within reach and changed frequently, as the sick will<lb/>
continually play with and slobber in the water while it is fresh. The<lb/>
amount of food taken by animals which are seriously ill often tells<lb/>
very heavily for or against recovery, and every endeavour should be<lb/>
made to induce them to take nourishment.
</p>

<p>
Instead of the ordinary dry feeds issued, cooking may sometimes be<lb/>
employed with advantage. Oats, barley and maize may be boiled till<lb/>
pulpy, and given cool. Linseed should be cooked very slowly and until<lb/>
the result is a glutinous mass ; it is most indigestible unless thoroughly<lb/>
cooked.
</p>

<p>
Green food of any description should be taken full advantage of, and,<lb/>
as a rule, any reasonable quantity may be given with safety. Animals<lb/>
which are weak from illness will occasionally lie down for days at a time<lb/>
and require considerable attention to prevent the occurrence of bed sores. Bed sores.<lb/>
These are pressure galls on those points where the weight of the animal<lb/>
is greatest when lying, and occur on the outside of the shoulder and<lb/>
elbow and point of the hip and stifle ; at first the skin is bruised and<lb/>
subsequently falls off, disclosing a round sore. The actual treatment of<lb/>
the sore should be carried out as explained under " Wounds," but for<lb/>
prevention the case should be turned over from time to time and the<lb/>
bedding levelled and kept thick and soft. Such cases, too, may some-<lb/>
times suffer from cramp, when they will struggle until their position is<lb/>
altered ; or the bowels or bladder may require relief, when an enema<lb/>
should be given or the catheter passed.
</p>

<p>
Fomenti?ig. â Let the water be hot and near the patient, soak the Foment-<lb/>
blanket or cloth, wring it out nearly dry, apply it to the part, and put a ^"^S-<lb/>
thick dry wrapping over it to keep the heat in. Change it every twenty<lb/>
minutes or half an hour.
</p>

<p>
Poulticing. â The object of poulticing is to soften the part ta which Poultic-<lb/>
the poultice is applied ; warm poultices also relieve pain. Bran or linseed ing-

<p>
meal are the best, and should be kept wet and not allowed to dry on the<lb/>
place to which they are applied. A cloth filled with tow or hay and kept<lb/>
wet and warm will answer the purpose, or simple fomentation, which is<lb/>
cleaner, when it can be applied.
</p>

<p>
Df'oiching. â Use a small horn or bottle with a leather-covered neck.<lb/>
Raise the head by placing the loop of a twitch in the mouth as a support<lb/>
(not on the lip), and do not pour down more than the horse can swallow<lb/>
at a time. If the animal coughs, lower the head immediately.
</p>

<p>
Balling. â Take the tongue in the left hand, but do not pull on it<lb/>
violently, turn it upwards so that it opens the mouth, and push the ball as<lb/>
far as possible over the root of the tongue. Stand at the side and not<lb/>
straight in front of the horse, and do the whole thing as quietly and<lb/>
quickly as possible. After delivering the ball, watch the left side of the<lb/>
neck to see it swallowed, and if the animal does not swallow quickly,<lb/>
give a mouthful of water or green stuff to induce it to do so.
</p>

<p>
E?ie?nas, clysters. â Should be copious to be effectual. For colic cases<lb/>
they may be given cold, but for all other cases they should be about<lb/>
blood heat. This may be easily judged by placing the arm in the water,<lb/>
which should feel very slightly warm. Oil or grease the enema nozzle so<lb/>
that it will enter the bowel easily.
</p>

<p>
General Measures for Dealing with Contagious<lb/>
Diseases.
</p>

<p>
Segregation. â The animals should be divided into three groups,<lb/>
i.e.^ affected, suspected and healthy. The suspected should<lb/>
include all those which have been in contact with the diseased,<lb/>
although they may not present any suspicious symptoms at the<lb/>
time. Attendants, watering, and feeding arrangements and all<lb/>
gear should be included in this separation and should be kept<lb/>
separate until the outbreak is over. The distance between the<lb/>
different groups should, if possible, be sufficiently far to prevent<lb/>
any chance communication between them, or when military<lb/>
considerations restrict the space at disposal, fencing of some<lb/>
sort should enclose each group, and if there is a prevailing<lb/>
wind the healthy should be placed to windward and the<lb/>
suspected and affected to leeward in the order named. Once<lb/>
an animal is placed in the affected group it should remain there<lb/>
till all danger is over, and on no account be replaced among the<lb/>
healthy, although it may perhaps have been moved in error in<lb/>
the first instance.

2. Disitifection. â Strict cleanliness of lines, gear, water troughs, Disinfec-
</p>

<p>
feeding boxes and bags, and personal cleanliness of attendants tion.<lb/>
is in itself a good safeguard against the spread of disease.
</p>

<p>
To disinfect opoi Hjics. â Scrape off the top layer of earth, strew the To disin-<lb/>
lines with litter, mix the scrapings with it and burn over the j^?^^ Â°P^"<lb/>
whole surface. Wood-work may be scraped and sprayed or<lb/>
washed with boiling water and a mop. Any disinfectant of<lb/>
recognised quality may be added to the water, or the wood<lb/>
may be painted with boiling tar ; this latter being an excellent<lb/>
method and easy to keep clean subsequently. Whitewash,<lb/>
which is so often used, is frequently put on without the old<lb/>
coats being scraped off, and at the best is not a good<lb/>
disinfectant. Quicklime or chloride of lime may be mixed with<lb/>
loose earth to disinfect it ; but in all cases where it can be used<lb/>
fire is the surest agent to employ if done thoroughly, and by<lb/>
means of the painters' lamp it can be employed almost<lb/>
universally.
</p>

<p>
Walls may be sprayed or scraped and scalded, scorched or tarred. Walls.
</p>

<p>
Enclosed buildings after being scraped may be shut up with<lb/>
sulphur burning in them. To do this successfully, proceed<lb/>
as follows : â Shut up all doors and windows, place the sulphur<lb/>
on a dish and wet it thoroughly with spirits of wine, then light it<lb/>
and leave it to burn. Keep the building closed for some hours.
</p>

<p>
Ironwork of saddlery^ etc., can be passed through a flame, and all Ironwork<lb/>
grooming kit and blankets should be soaked in a reliable ^f "<lb/>
disinfectant. Anything not worth the trouble or expense, such ^^^'<lb/>
as old lining of saddles or stuffing, brushes, etc., should be<lb/>
burnt. The personal disinfection of attendants and their clothes<lb/>
should not escape attention, as they are liable to carry the<lb/>
disease in some cases, particularly when dealing with mange,<lb/>
epizootic lymphangitis and rinderpest.
</p>

<p>
3. Inspections of all healthy and suspected animals should be carried Inspec-
</p>

<p>
out daily, and in cases where it may be a guide the temperature tions.<lb/>
of suspected animals should be recorded.
</p>

<p>
4. Destruction and disposal of dead.â To shoot the horse, use a pistol Destruc-
</p>

<p>
for choice. If obliged to use the small bore rifle, be very ^^Â°" ^^"JJ ^^<lb/>
careful that no one is standing within sight anywhere behind ^^^^^ ^<lb/>
the animal, as the bullets are apt to come out and traverse<lb/>
considerable distances. Stand close with the pistol, almost<lb/>
touching the forehead, and held at a right angle to the head.<lb/>
The head can be brought into a convenient position by offering

a handful of corn. Aim at the centre of the forehead, well
</p>

<p>
above the level of the eyes, just below the place where the lowest
</p>

<p>
hairs of the forelock grow. The animal will not fall forward,
</p>

<p>
but collapse exactly where it stands.
</p>

<p>
Disposal of the dead. â This is a consideration of importance. Glan-
</p>

<p>
dered carcases may be burned or buried. Anthrax carcases should be
</p>

<p>
buried luhole^ or if this cannot be satisfactorily done, burned. Those which
</p>

<p>
have died of cattle plague should be burned or well slashed to destroy
</p>

<p>
the hide and prevent it being used, and buried with some disinfectant,
</p>

<p>
such as quicklime. Surra carcases may be buried or burnt. These are
</p>

<p>
the safest methods of disposal, and, when practicable, should be adopted,
</p>

<p>
as the practice of leaving carcases about a line of march is a great
</p>

<p>
danger to all troops following. Litter should be burnt over ground where
</p>

<p>
discharges from the dead have fallen.
</p>

<p>
Contagious Diseases.
</p>

<p>
Fever. â The symptoms of fever in all animals are similar ; a high<lb/>
temperature, rapidity of the pulse and breathing, generally constipation<lb/>
of the bowels and a scanty and high-coloured urine. In addition,<lb/>
shivering fits may sometimes be seen, and the coat stares, but usually<lb/>
these symptoms have passed before the case is noticed. Fever cannot,<lb/>
as a rule, be looked upon as a disease of itself ; it is generally only one<lb/>
of the symptoms of a contagious disease which is causing it ; for instance,<lb/>
it accompanies cattle plague, anthrax, and many others.
</p>

<p>
Simple fever, that is a fever in which no definite cause can be found,<lb/>
may perhaps occur in the horse, and in such cases is generally an easy<lb/>
matter to deal with ; work, especially in hot climates, will cause the<lb/>
animal's temperature to rise temporarily, though it generally subsides<lb/>
quickly ; and this is more particularly the case where the atmosphere is<lb/>
full of moisture and the sun's rays are severely felt.
</p>

<p>
The treatment of fever should include a strict attention to the<lb/>
animal's comfort and the state of the bowels, this latter being, as it<lb/>
always is, extremely important, but physic balls should not be given.<lb/>
Warm enemas, about blood heat, may be administered two or three times<lb/>
daily when there is constipation.
</p>

<p>
The food, if there is any appetite, should not contain more than half<lb/>
the usual quantity of grain which the animal receives, and may be given<lb/>
sloppy or cooked with advantage. Green food of any description maybe<lb/>
given freely. Water should be always kept by the animal and frequently<lb/>
changed.

PREVENTION AND FIRST AID TREATMENT OF DISEASE. 3 II
</p>

<p>
It must be again repeated that the occurrence of fever in animals is<lb/>
usually a symptom of some other disease which produces the general<lb/>
symptoms just described in addition to those special to the disease.
</p>

<p>
Glanders- Farcy is a contagious disease peculiar to the horse and mule Glanders-<lb/>
and occasionally communicated to man. It is very slow in development *^^^y-<lb/>
in many cases, and may lie dormant in the system for a long time. It is<lb/>
communicated from one animal to another by the discharges from the<lb/>
diseased, and consequently calls for very strict measures of precaution<lb/>
when dealing with an outbreak.
</p>

<p>
The visible symptoms are a slight, sticky discharge from the nose,<lb/>
usually from one nostril, a hard lump under the jaw on the same side as<lb/>
the discharge, the lump feeling as if it was stuck on to the jaw and not<lb/>
freely movable. Small sores may appear in the nostril or in certain<lb/>
situations on the skin (farcy buds), and these have the same sticky<lb/>
discharge as seen from the nose and show no inclination to heal. When<lb/>
these sores are found on the legs the disease is popularly known as<lb/>
" farcy," but it is the same disease as glanders, only the ulcers are on the<lb/>
skin instead of the nose. The glanders-farcy ulcer is a small ragged-<lb/>
edged, angry-looking sore, covered, after it bursts, with a glutinous, not<lb/>
very copious, discharge ; they occur in lines one below the other, and<lb/>
the common situations for them are in the nose, down the inner sides of<lb/>
the limbs, and occasionally on the neck and face. In their neighbourhood<lb/>
the lymphatic vessels may be seen standing out under the skin like<lb/>
knotted cords, and it is in the course of the cords that the sores occur.<lb/>
Cases of this disease may linger on for a considerable period after these<lb/>
symptoms are observed, and should be destroyed, when the disease has<lb/>
been confirmed.
</p>

<p>
Measures for dealing with an outbreak. â The obviously diseased are Measures<lb/>
slaughtered and those that have been in contact with them segregated, for dealing<lb/>
Carry out strict disinfection of standings and gear. The tempera- ^^i^^^^j^<lb/>
tures of the in-contact animals are taken daily, as the first indication of<lb/>
the disease is often an irregular slight fever. A daily inspection<lb/>
of all animals is made, especially of the nose, beneath the jaw, and at<lb/>
the insides of the limbs. This disease almost invariably declares itself<lb/>
on service, and all cases with nasal discharges, especially if only from<lb/>
one side, should be regarded with suspicion and placed under<lb/>
observation, even if there is nothing else obviously the matter with them.
</p>

<p>
Remedial measures are not of any use, and once a case has been<lb/>
decided to have glanders, it is destroyed and the carcase, &amp;c., burnt or<lb/>
buried. The use of the diagnostic agent " mallein " now enables the<lb/>
veterinary service to deal with glanders in a much more satisfactory
</p>

manner than previously, and as a precaution all remounts are tested with<lb/>
It on joining the service to ascertain their freedom from the disease.
</p>

<p>
Epizootic Lyinphanptis. â This is a contagious disease which affects<lb/>
mules and horses. It Is highly contagious and may lie dormant In the<lb/>
system for a considerable time. The symptoms are the development of<lb/>
small abscesses along the course of the lymphatic vessels and generally<lb/>
down the limbs, though they may appear in other parts of the body,<lb/>
which become swollen and are very similar in general appearance to the<lb/>
condition described under Glanders-Farcy. There are certain distinctions,<lb/>
however, the readiness with which the sores heal, the fact that the<lb/>
Inflamed condition of the lymphatics and resulting abscesses always<lb/>
having their original starting point from a wound, and generally the<lb/>
absence of febrile symptoms. Nevertheless, the symptoms and appear-<lb/>
ance of both diseases are so similar that very great care should be taken<lb/>
to isolate all cases in the most rigid manner. This disease has been<lb/>
recently Imported Into, and stamped out of, the United Kingdom, but<lb/>
exists In South Africa and India, as well as many other countries.
</p>

<p>
Coughs and colds are of frequent occurrence among all animals,<lb/>
horses, mules and camels being the most frequent sufferers. Sudden<lb/>
changes of temperature, and exposure to draughts when heated or in<lb/>
stables are liable to cause them, and they are also prominent symptoms<lb/>
in outbreaks of Influenza. A cold (catarrh) is Inflammation of the lining<lb/>
of the nostrils, and a cough is produced by Inflammation of the lining of<lb/>
the throat (sore throat) : the two very frequently accompanying each<lb/>
other. The symptoms are discharge from the nostrils and the presence<lb/>
of a cough. The discharge is at first watery, but In the course of a few<lb/>
days it becomes greyish and thicker, and then alters to a yellow colour ;<lb/>
it runs freely from both nostrils and does not smell. The cough varies<lb/>
somewhat according to the state of the throat ; If the lining is dry and hot<lb/>
it will be a short, painful one, whilst when there Is much phlegm it Is<lb/>
hoarse and longer. Handling the throat and the effort of swallowing<lb/>
food frequently produces it, and when the swelling inside Is great or the<lb/>
throat Is very painful, the animal may be unable to swallow and the food<lb/>
returns through the nose. In severe colds fever may accompany them,<lb/>
and in such cases additional care should be taken to prevent the chance<lb/>
of the lungs becoming inflamed. What appear to be colds and sore<lb/>
throats may be the beginning of strangles or pneumonia.
</p>

<p>
Treatment. â General attention to comfort ; steam the head to ptomote<lb/>
free discharge ; rub the throat with the liniment. If the cough Is<lb/>
very painful, only such food as is easily swallowed should be given and<lb/>
the state of the bowels carefully attended to.

PREVENTION AND FIRST AID TREATMENT OF DISEASE. 313
</p>

<p>
Inflaimnation of the hmgs. â Pneumonia may occur from the extension Inflamma-<lb/>
of a cold into the lungs, or may, especially among horses, arise without any Jion of the<lb/>
visible cause, when it should be treated as a contagious disease and the '""?s-<lb/>
case segregated. In outbreaks of influenza among horses it is a somewhat<lb/>
common form for the disease to take. From whatever cause it arises the<lb/>
general symptoms are : The animal will probably be noticed dull and off<lb/>
feed ; there may be a history of a cold or cough for a day or two previ-<lb/>
ously ; the animal stands still, the forelegs probably a little wide apart,<lb/>
the breathing hurried, the pulse fast, and the temperature high. The<lb/>
lining of the eye will be generally found a brighter red than normal, and<lb/>
the bovvels are usually constipated. From day to day the changes to be<lb/>
observed are slight, the pulse remains fast but gets gradually weaker, the<lb/>
breathing remains hurried but may become more shallow, the tempera-<lb/>
ture keeps high and the appetite is gone or capricious. After a few<lb/>
days the animal begins to get visibly thinner, and the wasting is so rapid<lb/>
that at the end of a fortnight many cases are skin and bone. A slight<lb/>
rusty coloured discharge may be sometimes observed from the nostrils,<lb/>
and a painful cough is often a constant accompaniment. When the ribs<lb/>
over the lungs are struck with the tips of the fingers, the sound produced<lb/>
is duller than is natural.
</p>

<p>
Treatment. â In this disease, above all others, good nursing is neces- Treat-<lb/>
sary. The great thing is to get the case to eat sufficient food to keep up meat,<lb/>
the strength. Every variety of food may be tried to tempt the animal,<lb/>
and small quantities of different sorts should be left in the stable at<lb/>
night. Water should be kept within easy reach and changed whenever<lb/>
fouled. Warm enemas and green food should be frequently administered<lb/>
if the bowels are constipated, but physic balls are not to be given. If the<lb/>
case is weak, a daily stimulant is beneficial (carbonate of ammonia ball).<lb/>
After recovery a long rest is essential to allow the lungs to get back their<lb/>
elasticity.
</p>

<p>
Strangles is a fever of young horses, the prominent feature of which Strangles."<lb/>
is an abscess which develops between the branches of the lower jaw ;<lb/>
there is also fever, and in many cases the animals may be off their feed<lb/>
and get thin. It is contagious, but large outbreaks are chiefly confined<lb/>
to remount depots. The disease is a serious one and occasions severe<lb/>
animal losses ; it is closely associated with one form of pneumonia.
</p>

<p>
Symptons. â Fever and swelling beneath the jaw. This swelling is Symp-<lb/>
at first hard and diffused, but within a few days it becomes prominent tof"s.<lb/>
in the centre between the jaws and gets soft at the point. It then bursts<lb/>
and generally heals rapidly.
</p>

<p>
Treatment. â Feed the animal well and pay attention to the state of Treat-<lb/>
ment.

The general rules for dealing with contagious diseases and wounds<lb/>
apply.
</p>

<p>
Influenza Is a contagious fever which attacks horses and mules. It<lb/>
is chiefly to be feared when large bodies of animals are suddenly<lb/>
collected together, and specially if the sanitary surroundings are not good.
</p>

<p>
Symptoms. â Fever and great lassitude, with generally a highly<lb/>
coloured lining to the eye (pink eye), which may also be considerably<lb/>
swollen. When the disease attacks the chest and air passages, there<lb/>
will be discharge from the eyes and nose, resembling that described<lb/>
under catarrh, and in severe cases inflammation of the lungs may follow.<lb/>
In another form there may be rapid swellings of the limbs, and<lb/>
occasionally the bowels are affected and there is diarrhoea. It is easily<lb/>
communicated from one animal to another, and the usual precautions for<lb/>
dealing with contagious diseases should be observed.
</p>

<p>
Treat7}ient. â In this disease the weakness of the patient is great and<lb/>
the wasting rapid, whilst appetite is often wanting, or at any rate<lb/>
capricious. Nursing is of the greatest importance, and every endeavour<lb/>
should be made to get the patient to eat in order to keep up the strength.<lb/>
The body should be clothed and the legs bandaged warmly, whilst, if<lb/>
stabled, draughts should be avoided. After recovery ample rest should<lb/>
be given to recover the strength before being put to work again.
</p>

<p>
Surra. â A fever produced by a parasite in the blood, in most animals,<lb/>
but chiefly affecting horses, mules, and camels. It appears usually in<lb/>
swampy districts or countries, and is most prevalent during the rainy<lb/>
season. The parasite is conveyed from one animal to another by means<lb/>
of flies. It occurs in India, but not in England.
</p>

<p>
The symptoms are fever, which appears and disappears or gets less<lb/>
every few days ; dark red spots on the lining of the eye and nose, which<lb/>
are often yellowish ; the appearance of nettle-rash over the body, and<lb/>
later on swelling of the legs and lower surfaces of the body. The animal<lb/>
gets thin and weak, and usually dies in about six weeks from the time it<lb/>
was noticed to be ill.
</p>

<p>
Foot-and-mouth disease. â A fever which affects cattle particularly, but<lb/>
also sheep, goats and camels. Its special characteristics is the appearance<lb/>
of small blister-like eruptions in the mouth and around the junction of hair<lb/>
and hoof. It is extremely catching and must be dealt with strictly whenever<lb/>
discovered, as it may spread very rapidly and incapacitate cattle from<lb/>
work.

			<p>
PREVENTION AND FIRST AID TREATMENT OF DISEASE. 315
</p>

<p>
Symptoms. â The first thing noticed is usually that the animal is off Symp-<lb/>
feed and slavering at the mouth, and when watched it may be noticed toms.<lb/>
that the lips are " smacked " repeatedly. When the feet are attacked the<lb/>
animal is lame, and examination of both feet and mouth will show the<lb/>
characteristic bladders, which when broken leave a shallow sore. Under<lb/>
good treatment these usually heal rapidly.
</p>

<p>
Treatment. â Pay attention to the state of the bowels and give the Treat-<lb/>
cases soft food which they can eat without causing pain, washing out the ment.<lb/>
mouth occasionally with weak boric or alum lotion. Treat the sores<lb/>
around the feet antiseptically. As a rule, the disease runs a mild course,<lb/>
but if the feet are allowed to get dirty the hoofs sometimes slough off. As<lb/>
this disease is very rapidly spread, the strictest isolation of any animal or<lb/>
unit in which it occurs should be observed. If no case occurs for a fort-<lb/>
night atter the last case has recovered, the outbreak may be considered<lb/>
over.
</p>

<p>
Cattle plague., rinderpest. â Affects all ruminants, and is most common Cattle<lb/>
and fatal in India among oxen. It is a highly contagious disease, and plague,<lb/>
the strictest precaution should be taken to try and prevent its spread. nnder-
</p>

<p>
Syinptoms. â The disease is so general and widespread in India that Symp-<lb/>
many of the cattle are naturally more or less inoculated against it and toms.<lb/>
have a mild form. The prominent symptoms are want of appetite, cessation<lb/>
of rumination and purging. On closer examination it will be found that<lb/>
there is fever, a bran-like eruption on the inside of the lips and on the<lb/>
gums ; the lining of the eye and mouth become purple or spotted ; there<lb/>
is often a profuse discharge from the eyes and sometimes the nose, and<lb/>
in many cases the motions are bloody. The animal separates itself from<lb/>
the herd, the back is arched and there may be considerable straining to<lb/>
pass the faeces. The case rapidly loses flesh and, as a rule, death ensues<lb/>
in four to eight days. Mild cases recover slowly, but this is naturally a<lb/>
rarer occurrence on service than elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Prevention. â Separate the diseased, in-contact, and healthy into Preven-<lb/>
three herds. Among " in-contact " include all which have stood near the tion.<lb/>
diseased. Disinfect all standings, mangers, &amp;c., burn any line gear,<lb/>
litter, fodder, and droppings which are found on the standings of<lb/>
the diseased. If possible, burn carcases of dead. Among slaughter<lb/>
cattle kill off the "in-contact" first, among working oxen keep them<lb/>
separate and, if necessary, work ithem separately. It is often better<lb/>
on service to kill off and burn or bury any diseased or doubtful cases as<lb/>
soon as discovered. If there has been no case for three weeks the<lb/>
outbreak may be considered over.

3l6 ANIMAL MANAGEMENT.
</p>

<p>
Anthrax, Anthrax is a rapidly fatal disease, produced by the growth of a germ
</p>

<p>
in the blood. It attacks all animals and may be conveyed from one to<lb/>
another, but is most generally caused by the germ being consumed in<lb/>
the food or water.
</p>

<p>
The general symptoms are the same in all animals ; high fever, want<lb/>
of appetite, rapidly increasing swellings in various parts of the body,<lb/>
spotting and purple colouring of the lining of the eye and nose, bloody<lb/>
discharges from the nose and sometimes the bowels, and rapid death.
</p>

<p>
In the horse the patient may be found in many cases with swelling<lb/>
of the throat, which rapidly increases. This swelling, which is common<lb/>
in all cases of the disease, is rather soft and doughy to the feel ; the<lb/>
finger pressed into it will leave a dent ; it may occur in the chest or<lb/>
belly, when chest symptoms or colicky pains will be shown. Later a<lb/>
rusty or bloody discharge may be seen to run from the nostrils, and<lb/>
death occurs in about 24 to 48 hours. Among cattle it is quite usual<lb/>
to find the animals dead, the disease being very sudden in its course,<lb/>
but in other cases the characteristic swellings appear and the case lasts<lb/>
for a day or two, presenting the same symptoms as already described.<lb/>
When cattle are found dead there is often a bloody discharge from the<lb/>
bowel.
</p>

<p>
After death the general appearances are a tarry-liquid condition of<lb/>
the blood, great enlargement of the spleen, and yellow jelly-like swellings<lb/>
in the chest, belly or throat, and in cattle under the skin.
</p>

<p>
Preven- Preveiitio?i. â As the disease is usually introduced by the food,
</p>

<p>
tion. this should be changed when possible. There is little danger
</p>

<p>
of animals getting it from one another if strict precautions are<lb/>
observed, as follows : separation as soon as found ill, burning of all litter,<lb/>
fodder, droppings, line gear, &amp;c., of the diseased over the places where<lb/>
they have stood. In stables, walls should be scorched with a flame as<lb/>
high up as the animal can reach its nose, scraped and washed with a<lb/>
strong disinfectant. The top layer of earth from earthen standings<lb/>
should be removed and burnt with litter, &amp;c. Carcases should be<lb/>
buried whole â not slashed or cut in any way. This is the safest method,<lb/>
care being taken that no discharges drop from the body. When<lb/>
carcases are ordered to be burnt, great care should be taken to burn<lb/>
litter over the blood which is spilt in cutting up the carcase.<lb/>
Curative measures are of no avail.
</p>

<p>
Mange. " Majiore is produced by small insects which live in or on the skin ;
</p>

<p>
it is found in all animals ; and each class of animal has its own<lb/>
particular variety of itch insects. On service this disease is a constant<lb/>
source of trouble and loss, and deserves particular attention, as it is

very easily spread and often cured with difficulty. In the horse and<lb/>
mule there are two troublesome forms â
</p>

<p>
(i) the dry, produced by insects which live beneath the skin.
</p>

<p>
(2) the moist, in which they are found on the surface of the skin.
</p>

<p>
Sympto))is. â In both cases the common situations for the disease to Syinp-<lb/>
be first noticed are on the head, withers and back, and sometimes, but'toms.<lb/>
less frequently, the quarters. In the dry form small pimples may be<lb/>
felt about as big as a pin's head, and from these the hair falls, leaving<lb/>
a small pea-sized bald spot. In the wet form a moist, rapidly-increasing<lb/>
patch will be seen from which the hair falls, and in both cases there<lb/>
is severe itching. If the place be gently scratched the animal will smack or<lb/>
nibble with his lips and lean or rub against the hand ; when being groomed<lb/>
they will lean heavily against the brush, and when loose they will scrub<lb/>
against anything rough with such violence as to make the skin bleed.
</p>

<p>
hi the camel. â The parts first attacked are those where the hair is In the<lb/>
thin or which are in contact with the ground when the animal sits camel,<lb/>
down ; the insides of the legs, lower part of the body, neck and sides.<lb/>
The animal rubs its legs together or scrapes itself against trees ; the<lb/>
appearance of the diseased patches is much the same as described above,<lb/>
and later the skin becomes thickened and scurfy.
</p>

<p>
Ill the bullock the disease may be usually first noticed round the In the<lb/>
root of the tail, but may also be found on the body, the symptoms bullock,<lb/>
being identical with those previously described, but not usually so acute.
</p>

<p>
The disease is of great importance on service owing to the loss of<lb/>
working power or even mortality which it causes. When well fed,<lb/>
groomed, and clothed it may not be so marked in its effects, but when<lb/>
work is hard and food scanty, animals rapidly waste and die from the<lb/>
constant irritation.
</p>

<p>
Treatme7it. â Segregation and strict disinfection, clip off the hair and Treat-<lb/>
burn it and dress the case thoroughly, and, if possible, all over with '"ent.<lb/>
the following mixture : Paraffin oil i pint, soap i lb., water i gallon.<lb/>
There are many other dressings, but this is useful and can always be<lb/>
got. Taramera oil may be also used with effect, especially on the<lb/>
camel, and should be rubbed in freely. Keep the dressing on for several<lb/>
days and rub it in lightly daily with the hand. Then wash well with<lb/>
soap and water, and keep under observation for at least three weeks.<lb/>
Keep the animal well fed, but clothing, except in the case of isolated<lb/>
cases in private horses, should be withdrawn from any unit in which the<lb/>
disease exists till the outbreak is over, as it is one of the main sources of<lb/>
contagion. All gear, blankets, Â«&amp;c., should be soaked in a disinfectant<lb/>
before being used again. Daily inspections of all animals of a unit which

</p>

<p>
Lockjaiu (Tetanus) is caused by a germ which gains entrance to the<lb/>
body by wounds and which is found in the ground. It most usually,<lb/>
therefore, follows such wounds as pricks of the feet and broken knees,<lb/>
which come in contact with the soil. The symptoms are stiffness and<lb/>
constant spasm of the muscles of the jaws (lockjaw), neck and back ;<lb/>
the other muscles of the body may be affected, but it is most noticeable<lb/>
in those mentioned. The jaws are fixed, the tail is drawn to one side<lb/>
and quivers ; if the head is lifted up the haw or third eyelid appears and<lb/>
the animal is very easily startled. The mouth is often seen covered with<lb/>
food from the patient's efforts to eat, and this may be the first thing to<lb/>
draw attention to the case. Treatmoit. â Keep the animal as quiet as<lb/>
possible, separated from others and away from all noise, give a noiseless<lb/>
bed which is easy to walk about on, such as sand or old short litter ;<lb/>
feed on plenty of boiled sloppy food which the animal can suck down ;<lb/>
give at the outset a dose of physic, and having put plenty of food and<lb/>
water within easy reach, do not allow anyone near the animal for twelve<lb/>
hours at a time. Absolute quiet is the best treatment. In all cases look<lb/>
for wounds, and thoroughly cleanse and treat them with antiseptics.<lb/>
Cases which Hve over ten days generally recover if carefully nursed.
</p>

<p>
Ring'worm^ round bald patches, covered with greyish scales about<lb/>
the size of a florin, common in all animals and caused by a fungus growing<lb/>
at the root of the hairs, is contagious but not always serious. Clip off the<lb/>
hair round the patch, and dress with iodine (tincture or ointment) both<lb/>
over and around the spot.
</p>

<p>
NON-CONTAGIOUS CONDITIONS.
</p>

<p>
Staggers, Staggers is a general term, which includes any condition which
</p>

<p>
causes the horse to suddenly fall and be incapable of getting up again.<lb/>
The usual causes are pressure of the collar or breast harness on the large<lb/>
vessels of the neck, which causes a congestion of the brain, or the effect<lb/>
of the sun combined with work. This is the usual cause in a hot country,<lb/>
and the attacks are most frequent during damp, muggy weather, horses<lb/>
which pant and feel the heat being most likely to get them. The ox and<lb/>
buffalo also feel the sun greatly when working, and will often lie down<lb/>
and decline to rise if they are exhausted ; in such cases it is better not to<lb/>
attempt to make the animal continue work until recovered from the<lb/>
exhaustion. In horses the symptoms are a sudden reeling gait and<lb/>
generally falling, the hind-quarters being frequently quite paralysed ;

<p>
some cases are quiet when down, others are very violent and require<lb/>
holding down. Treatment. â Shade from the sun, cold water to head<lb/>
and spine, and keep as quiet as possible. When recovered give a<lb/>
purgative and soft feeding for some days. Cases of staggers not due to<lb/>
the above causes are usually from brain affections, and have to be cast.
</p>

<p>
Rheumatism is not a frequent disease among animals, but may be Rheuma-<lb/>
observed on service when there is a great daily variation of temperature tism.<lb/>
or after an outbreak of influenza. Horses and camels are liable to it,<lb/>
more particularly camels. Where the days are very hot and the nights<lb/>
equally cold, these animals are often observed to be " cold struck," stiff<lb/>
all over â a form of muscular rheumatism. Brisk rubbing with the hand<lb/>
or brush, and moderate exercise when the sun is warm, is generally a<lb/>
sufficient treatment. When the affection attacks the joints these are<lb/>
swollen and painful and should be kept warm, and may be rubbed with<lb/>
the liniment provided. In all cases the bowels should be kept soft and<lb/>
freely moved.
</p>

<p>
Debility cannot be considered a disease, but it is a condition which Debility,<lb/>
so frequently demands treatment on service that it must be given<lb/>
attention. The causes of weakness and loss of condition on service in all<lb/>
animals are want of food or want of time to consume it, over-work and<lb/>
exposure. To these must be added such diseases as cause subsequent<lb/>
weakness, particularly mange. As a rule, such cases only require a rest<lb/>
and judicious management as regards their food,''and on this head it<lb/>
should be remembered that an exhausted, debilitated animal is unaWe to<lb/>
digest large amounts of food at a time ; the stomach and bowels are not<lb/>
equal to it ; and as a rule better results can be obtained by giving them<lb/>
moderate quantities of easily digested material and feeding them often.<lb/>
They should also be protected from all unnecessary exposure and kept<lb/>
clothed if the weather requires it. Medicinal treatment is of secondary<lb/>
importance to nursing in such cases.
</p>

<p>
Exhaustioti from fatigue may be met with after heavy work. The Exhaus-<lb/>
symptoms are usually that the animal on reaching the journey's end lies tion.<lb/>
down and shows no inclination to feed, though it maybe unusually thirsty.<lb/>
Sometimes there is considerable sweating, but the body will be found<lb/>
cold and the pulse feeble. Clothe warmly, give a carbonate of ammonia<lb/>
ball. If possible, give a warm mash instead of the usual feed.
</p>

<p>
Lampas is inflammation of the gum behind the incisor teeth of the Lampas.<lb/>
upper jaw of the horse. It is seen only in young animals when changing<lb/>
their teeth, and does not occur among adults. It may be noted that the<lb/>
horse's palate immediately behind the upper incisor teeth is often below<lb/>
the level of them, and this is frequently mistaken for lampas. When it

<p>
does occur it is from food working up between the teeth, and the removal<lb/>
of this and soft feeding is all that is necessary.<lb/>
Choking. Choking \s the stoppage of something in the gullet which the animal
</p>

<p>
has swallowed and which is unable to pass down to the stomach. It is<lb/>
most frequent in cattle, but may also occur in other animals. In the<lb/>
horse, hastily swallowed bran or gram or carrot, and in cattle pieces of<lb/>
sugar-cane or roots are the most frequent causes. The symptoms produced<lb/>
are great uneasiness and spasmodic attempts at vomiting, the head being<lb/>
drawn towards the chest and then suddenly shot out. If the obstruction<lb/>
is in the neck it may be readily seen. In cattle, hoven rapidly comes on<lb/>
if relief is not afforded.
</p>

<p>
Treatment. â ^Give small doses of oil repeatedly (about two ounces) ;<lb/>
in cattle pass the probang ; in horses, do not attempt this but walk the<lb/>
animal about. Do not allow water to drink, as it will cause the obstruc-<lb/>
tion to swell, and if the stoppage is complete it will only return through<lb/>
the nostrils ; after relief is obtained starve the animal for twelve hours.
</p>

<p>
" Roaring " is the noise made during hard breathing by horses which<lb/>
have one side of their larynx paralysed. This makes the opening of the<lb/>
windpipe smaller than it should be, and so a "whistle" or "roar" is<lb/>
produced when breathing is quick and deep, as in galloping.
</p>

<p>
"Broken wind" is due to an affection of the lungs, and animals<lb/>
affected have a difficulty in expiration, so that a special effort to do so<lb/>
may be noticed on looking at the flank (see p. 305).
</p>

<p>
Crib-bitiiig and wind-suckmg. â Both these vices consist in the<lb/>
swallowing of air by the animal. The cribber lays hold of the manger or<lb/>
anything else within reach, arches and sets the muscles of his neck, and<lb/>
gives a grunt at the moment he swallows ; whilst the wind-sucker does<lb/>
the same thing without laying hold of anything with his. teeth. These<lb/>
vicious habits are important from the fact that they give rise to loss of<lb/>
condition, indigestion, and colic, and various measures are adopted to<lb/>
prevent them. The wind-sucker, or flute bit is probably the best device :<lb/>
it is simply a hollow iron bit with holes bored in it like a flute and<lb/>
prevents the animal sucking ; it should be worn constantly. A tight<lb/>
broad strap round the top of the neck will also prevent the habit for a<lb/>
time and can be worn even at work.<lb/>
Colic. Colic is the name given to the train of symptoms which animals show
</p>

<p>
when they have got pain in the belly : the pain may be actually due to a<lb/>
variety of causes, but the symptoms exhibited are often similar. The<lb/>
majority of the causes of colic are connected with the food and feeding,<lb/>
and if cases are at all frequent, a strict enquiry should be made into<lb/>
feeding arrangements. Crib-biting, wind-sucking, bolting food, unsuitable

<p>
or unsuitably prepared food, sudden changes of food, a surfeit of green<lb/>
fodder, watering or working severely immediately after feeding, are all<lb/>
causes of indigestion and colicky pains. In the horse we may distinguish<lb/>
two distinct forms of colic^ â spasmodic and flatulent.
</p>

<p>
Syinptoiiis â spasmodic colic. â The pain is not continuous, but there Symp-<lb/>
are intervals of ease between the spasms during which the animal toms.â<lb/>
appears quite well until another spasm suddenly occurs. The case is Spasmodic<lb/>
generally violent, paws, stamps, kicks at its belly, lies or throws itself ^Â° ^^'<lb/>
down, rolls, crouches in the loins when walking, stretches itself out as if<lb/>
trying to stale, looks round at the sides, sweats in patches or, in very<lb/>
severe cases, all over ; the pulse is fast, the breathing hurried and<lb/>
distressed, the lining of the eye a bright red, the mouth dry, but the<lb/>
temperature remains normal. Many or all of the symptoms may be<lb/>
observed inside five minutes, and then there will be a cessation of pain<lb/>
and the animal will appear well till another sudden spasm occurs. As<lb/>
the attack progresses the pains get more frequent and longer and the<lb/>
rests shorter. When relief is obtained the symptoms disappear very<lb/>
quickly. Flatulent or zuindy colic is due to fermentation of the food in Flatulent<lb/>
the bowels, which become distended by the resulting gases. The belly colic,<lb/>
is inflated, giving the animal an unnaturally rotund appearance, and the<lb/>
pain is continuous, though not so violent as in the spasmodic variety.<lb/>
The animal does not throw itself about so much, but appears somewhat<lb/>
sleepy, though uneasy and fidgety, scraping, Avandering slowly round,<lb/>
attempting to lie doAvn but afraid to do so, while the pulse remains fast<lb/>
and the temperature is not altered.
</p>

<p>
In both varieties there is usually severe constipation during the whole<lb/>
of the attack. Treatment should be directed to two points, viz., the<lb/>
relief of the pain and stimulation of bowels. For the first, any of the<lb/>
following remedies may be given : â -The animal should be walked about<lb/>
and hot fomentations applied to the belly and a chloral hydrate ball given<lb/>
for the immediate relief of the pain. To stimulate the action of the<lb/>
bowels copious enemas should be given every half hour, and if the case<lb/>
is not relieved in two hours, a physic ball should be given. Other<lb/>
remedies for the relief of pain which may be administered and are likely<lb/>
to be procurable are, ginger, t\vo teaspoonfulls ; brandy, or other spirit,<lb/>
4 ounces ; turpentine, i or 2 ounces. The turpentine must be mixed with<lb/>
oil, I pint, or beaten up with eggs and milk. For cattle and camels the<lb/>
doses may be doubled.
</p>

<p>
In cattle the most common condition which produces colicky pains is<lb/>
" hoven," or a flatulent condition of the rumen, caused by fermentation of<lb/>
the food in it. The distension is most noticeable in the left flank, which<lb/>

<p>
is swollen and gives out a drum-like sound when tapped ; the animal is<lb/>
uneasy, kicks at its belly and grunts from the pain.
</p>

<p>
In slight cases two carbonate of ammonia balls will give relief, and it<lb/>
is advisable to give a laxative â Epsom salts, i lb., or Hnseed oil i^ pints.
</p>

<p>
Camels also suffer this condition, and when in pain champ the jaws,<lb/>
kick and roll or simply press the belly firmly on the ground when lying.<lb/>
The same treatment as for cattle may be carried out.
</p>

<p>
Constipation is due to want of sufficient activity of the bowels and is<lb/>
to be avoided as being a contributory factor to indigestion and colic.<lb/>
Change of food, cooked or v/et feeds, green fodder and enemas will<lb/>
overcome it,, and if these prove insufficient small doses of physic may be<lb/>
given.<lb/>
Diarrhoea. Diarrhcea is met with on service as the result of overwork, exposure<lb/>
or unsuitable foods, and in the horse particularly is sometimes very<lb/>
troublesome. Dry foods will sometimes stop it, and a dose of oil or aloes<lb/>
is advisable to clear any irritating matter out of the bowels. In cases<lb/>
which are obstinate, both in constipation and diarrhoea, a strict attention<lb/>
to the feeding is the m.ost effectual treatment as a rule. When it is<lb/>
persistent a carbonate of ammonia ball will frequently stop it.
</p>

<p>
Worms in the bowels are very common in all animals, and when in<lb/>
excessive numbers may cause loss of condition. Green food aids in their<lb/>
expulsion, and turpentine, one ounce together with a dose of oil, may<lb/>
be given ; for the small round worms found in the rectum of horses an<lb/>
injection of salt (four ounces) in a bucket of warm water will be found<lb/>
useful.
</p>

<p>
Ticks are numerous in some localities, and may be killed by touching<lb/>
them with carbolic acid or turpentine. If they are pulled off, the head<lb/>
sometimes remains in the skin and festers.
</p>

<p>
Leeches are numerous in some pools and streams, and occasionally<lb/>
fasten on to the hps, and crawl up the nostrils and mouths of animals<lb/>
when drinking. Their presence may be suspected from the animal<lb/>
snuffling or bleeding occasionally from one nostril. Keep the patient<lb/>
without water for 24 hours, and then when it is offered the leech will probably<lb/>
appear and may be seized. When they are found on the skin the applica-<lb/>
tion of salt and water causes them to drop off. Any pool known to be<lb/>
infested with them should be avoided as a watering place, or the water<lb/>
previously filtered through a cloth.
</p>

<p>
Lice may constantly be found on camels, and occasionally on horses,<lb/>
on which they cause considerable irritation. They may be readily<lb/>
detected on looking carefully into the coat, and the affected animals should<lb/>
be clipped, if possible, the hair burnt where it falls and the skin well

washed with tobacco water (four ounces of tobacco boiled with a gallon<lb/>
of water).
</p>

<p>
Nettle-rash may frequently be seen on the skin of the horse, the most Nettle-<lb/>
usual situation being the side of the neck, but occasionally all over the rash,<lb/>
body. It appears as flat swellings varying from a small beam to a patch<lb/>
as large as a plate in size, coming suddenly and generally disappearing<lb/>
in a few hours. It is usually of little importance, and a change of food<lb/>
and care not to water when the animal is heated is all that is necessary<lb/>
to ensure it not recurring. In febrile diseases, and especially surra, nettle-<lb/>
rash is a frequent symptom.
</p>

<p>
Barsati is the Indian name for ulcers of the skin, which appear generally Barsati,<lb/>
rour.d the lips, eyes, coronets and fetlocks, and sometimes on the sheath<lb/>
and penis of the horse ; they are liable to recur annually, heal with<lb/>
difficulty, and chalky lumps (kankar) are found in them. They disappear<lb/>
during the cold season or when the animal goes to the hills. They are<lb/>
said to be due to minute worms in the blood-vessels.
</p>

<p>
Lymphangitis (weed, Monday morning disease, big leg) of the hind Lymphan-<lb/>
legs may be found chiefly amongst hard- worked animals after a day's rest. &amp;itis.<lb/>
The leg suddenly swells, and there may be knotted cords down the inside<lb/>
of the thighs ; in severe cases the skin may ooze a little sticky fluid. This<lb/>
disease may be confounded with the swollen hind legs seen in some cases<lb/>
of glanders-farcy, from which it is distinguished by the suddenness of its<lb/>
appearance, generally after a rest, and the absence of ulcers (farcy buds).<lb/>
There is great pain and lameness. Treatment. â Give a physic ball,<lb/>
excercise two or three times in the day for short periods. Horses known<lb/>
to get this disease should get regular exercise and light feeding when not<lb/>
at work.
</p>

<p>
Wounds and Injuries.
</p>

<p>
Under this heading the majority of cases which can be successfully<lb/>
dealt with in the lines on service occur, as many of them are, at the<lb/>
outset, slight, and if properly attended to the animals can be often kept<lb/>
at work.
</p>

<p>
Wounds may, for the purposes of description, be divided into (i)<lb/>
Clean cut, (2) Torn, (3) Bruised, and (4) Punctured : â
</p>

<p>
I. Clean cut wounds, inflicted by a sharp-edged instrument, are simply
</p>

<p>
a division of the skin and muscles without any loss of substance.
</p>

<p>
They are characterised by the freedom with which they bleed
</p>

<p>
and the subsequent readiness with which they will heal ; the

</p>

<p>
reason being that the blood-vessels, which are sharply divided<lb/>
without tearing or stretching, remain wide open, and when the<lb/>
bleeding has stopped the two cut surfaces, not being bruised or<lb/>
torn, come together readily and join with comparative quickness,<lb/>
there being no loss of substance to make good in the healing<lb/>
process.
</p>

<p>
2. Torn wounds, made by blunt instruments, such as hooks, do not
</p>

<p>
bleed quite so freely nor heal so readily as clean cut ones. This<lb/>
is owing to the fact that the parts are stretched considerably by<lb/>
the blunt edge of whatever causes the wound, which, being<lb/>
unable to cut clean, tears its Avay through, and consequently the<lb/>
blood-vessels, which are elastic, fly back like india-rubber and<lb/>
twist themselves into knots which stop the bleeding. Again, as<lb/>
the flesh is torn, portions of it are so badly injured that they<lb/>
subsequently die, and as these dead pieces must come away before<lb/>
healing can be completed, this class of wounds takes a longer<lb/>
time to repair.
</p>

<p>
3. Bruised wounds comprise many of the worst injuries met with, and
</p>

<p>
are most difficult to successfully treat ; for being caused by falls<lb/>
and blows from blunt objects, not only has the wound itself to be<lb/>
considered, but also the bruise which has been sustained, and<lb/>
this is often the most serious part of the injury. Under this<lb/>
heading are included such cases as broken knees, many saddle<lb/>
galls from pressure, treads, some over-reaches, and in fact all<lb/>
wounds which have been accompanied by a severe contusion.<lb/>
Bruised wounds bleed but little, but there is often considerable<lb/>
loss of skin, and the surrounding portions Avhich have not been<lb/>
actually killed are so severely hurt that they subsequently<lb/>
die, and the wound which at first appeared a trifle, will be larger<lb/>
and deeper after the lapse of a few days, the healing being<lb/>
thereby considerably retarded.
</p>

<p>
4. Punctured wounds, so frequent in the feet of animals from treading
</p>

<p>
on nails, sharp stones, &amp;c,, or from thorns entering the skin, are<lb/>
dangerous from the fact that the small opening in the horn or<lb/>
skin made by them closes immediately, and should any dirt or<lb/>
poison have been carried into the wound, it will create inflamma-<lb/>
tion and matter will form ; for this reason it is often necessary<lb/>
to enlarge the opening in order to thoroughly cleanse the wound<lb/>
beneath. On the other hand, if the penetrating object be<lb/>
perfectly clean, they may heal without any trouble at all, and<lb/>
they bleed but very slightly.

<p>
Wounds made by firearms vary according to the missile which inflicts<lb/>
them. A piece of shell makes a jagged hole, which is both bruised and<lb/>
torn, whilst a small bore bullet will either puncture a little hole in the<lb/>
muscles and soft bones, or may make a large smashing injury if it<lb/>
encounters the resistance of a hard, solid bone.
</p>

<p>
The healing of wounds takes place in slightly different ways according The<lb/>
to the class to which they belong, but in the main the process is similar healing<lb/>
in all. With clean cut wounds there may, provided they are absolutely of wounds,<lb/>
clean, be a direct joining of the severed surfaces, and the wound will<lb/>
then heal in a very few days, but, generally speaking, this is a result<lb/>
seldom obtainable in animals, because of the conditions under which<lb/>
their wounds are usually received. When, as in torn and bruised wounds,<lb/>
there is a certain amount of dead and dying skin or flesh around the<lb/>
wound, this comes away with the discharge from the surface before healing<lb/>
takes place, and in bruised wounds especially the amount which does so<lb/>
is sometimes considerable. From the sides and bottom of the wound<lb/>
there then grows a bright pink mass of granulations, which on reaching<lb/>
the level of the skin, hardens on the surface and forms a scar.
</p>

<p>
A scar is not skin but a good substitute for it ; it is, however, more<lb/>
likely to be chafed or rubbed than skin, as it is neither so elastic nor<lb/>
strong.
</p>

<p>
Wounds of the surface of the skin only â grazes, for instanceâ generally<lb/>
heal under a scab, which is formed by the clotting of the slight quantity<lb/>
of bloody fluid which oozes from them, and under this dry cap the granula-<lb/>
tions grow till, when they are level, they push the scab off.
</p>

<p>
A perfectly healthy healing wound should be a bright pink, the<lb/>
surrounding edge whitish and without any matter discharging from it.
</p>

<p>
Discharges from wounds are caused either by dead or dying material<lb/>
which is in the wound, or by the growth of germs, and it must be<lb/>
distinctly understood that no such thing as what is popularly called a<lb/>
"healthy" discharge exists. All are harmful and should be got rid of by<lb/>
treatment as soon as possible.
</p>

<p>
Treatment of wounds. â The great principle in the successful treat- Treat-<lb/>
ment of wounds may be summed up in the word " cleanliness." ment of<lb/>
Cleanliness of the wound itself, of the dressings and the dresser are of ^'^'""^"^<lb/>
the greatest importance, and although wounds will often heal in spite of<lb/>
dirt and bad treatment, they do so much quicker, better and more<lb/>
certainly when these points are strictly observed. Let it be understood<lb/>
a wound is not " healed " by any treatment ; the treatment should keep it<lb/>
thoroughly clean and Nature repairs it. The danger of much so-called<lb/>
treatment must here be called attention to, the application of dirty dress-

<p>
ings, by dirty hands to wounds, is frequently the means of spreading<lb/>
disease instead of stopping it, and the thorough 'and skilful use of soap<lb/>
and water is frequently of more benefit than such misapplied remedies.<lb/>
Bleeding. Stoppage of bleeding is the first point lo be attended to if it is serious.
</p>

<p>
In the majority of wounds it is not. Bleeding may be from an artery, a<lb/>
vein, or mixed. From an artery the blood is bright scarlet and spurts<lb/>
out in a jerky stream, each successive jerk corresponding to a beat of the<lb/>
heart ; from a vein there is a steady flow of a darker red colour ; mixed<lb/>
-* bleeding is what is commonly seen from ordinary wounds, and comes from
</p>

<p>
the small vessels, which are numerous all over the body.
</p>

<p>
The readiest means of stopping bleeding is pressure, which may be<lb/>
carried out by tight bandaging al30ve and below the wound, or by placing<lb/>
a pad on the wound and bandaging over it (the pad may be lint, tow, a<lb/>
folded cloth), or for severe bleeding a tourniquet may be applied (to a<lb/>
limb) above the wound. This may be improvised by tying a cord or strip<lb/>
of linen round the leg loosely, and then twisting a stick in it till it is so<lb/>
tight that it stops the circulation. It must be remembered that this<lb/>
severe pressure cannot be borne for long without causing the leg to swell,<lb/>
and should be removed as soon as possible, and for ordinary wounds a<lb/>
simple pad and bandage over is usually sufficient to control the flow. If<lb/>
there happens to be a large vessel cut and the end exposed, it should be tied<lb/>
round with a clean thread which has been soaked in an antiseptic. For<lb/>
wounds with a small opening, where a large vessel has been cut (usually<lb/>
inside the arm and thigh), a large pin may be stuck through both lips of<lb/>
the wound and a twist of tow or lint tied round it in a figure of 8.
</p>

<p>
Bleeding stops because the blood clots in the mouths of the wounded<lb/>
vessels, and this having. happened, all outside clots should be cleared<lb/>
and the wound dressed with an antiseptic.<lb/>
Anti- An antiseptic is an agent which either kills germs or prevents'them

septics. from growing on wounds ; many are known, and although some may be<lb/>
preferred to others for special purposes, it is not as a rule of so much<lb/>
importance which particular one is used as that it should be thoroughly<lb/>
and intelligently employed.
</p>

<p>
In their application it should be remembered that some of them are<lb/>
irritating subst mces which when used in too strong solutions, burn<lb/>
the wounds and retard their rapid healing, and they should, therefore,<lb/>
always be employed as weak as is consistent with efficiency.
</p>

<p>
Carbolic acid must be applied frequently, as it evaporates quickly.
</p>

<p>
Sulphate of zinc is useful to apply to wounds which are not looking<lb/>
quite healthy, and restores their colour and tone. Weak solutions<lb/>
(i â loo) of phenyle, Jeyes' fluid, Sanitas, Macdougall's sheep dip, Lysol

<p>
or Cresyl, can also be used when obtainable, and are excellent<lb/>
antiseptics.
</p>

<p>
Washing ivou?ids. â When a wound is perfectly healthy with no Washing<lb/>
discharge, water should be used as little as possible, but at the same wounds,<lb/>
time with wounds in animals it is generally necessary to wash them or<lb/>
the surrounding parts thoroughly with soap and water, and they should<lb/>
be dried carefully afterwards. In dry, hot climates this cannot do harm,<lb/>
but in damp weather it should be avoided if possible and dry dressings<lb/>
employed. Having dressed the wounds, they should be covered with a<lb/>
piece of antiseptic lint or tow, and a sufficiently thick pad of the same to<lb/>
soak up discharges and prevent any dirt getting on them ; but if a<lb/>
bandage cannot be applied, it is better to cover them with a thin<lb/>
network of antiseptic cotton wool, which will stay on by itself.
</p>

<p>
To irrigate woiaids constantly, take a tin or bucket, make a small To irrigate<lb/>
hole in the bottom large enough to admit a stout string, run the string wounds,<lb/>
through and fill with water. The water will trickle constantly down the<lb/>
string, which should be loosely looped round the place required to be<lb/>
irrigated.
</p>

<p>
Bajidas^ing over wou7ids should only be carried out where there is no Bandaging<lb/>
chance of causing swelling, and care must be taken not to draw any one over<lb/>
portion tighter than another. For the legs loose pyjamas tied with a wounds,<lb/>
running tape at top and bottom and suspended from the surcingle or a<lb/>
crupper are most useful.
</p>

<p>
Stitchino; wou?tds in animals should only be undertaken when the Stitching<lb/>
parts can be kept at rest, and the wound, needles, sutures and operator's wounds.<lb/>
hands are absolutely clean ; it should not be done when there is the<lb/>
likelihood of much swelling round the injury or when the edges are<lb/>
badly bruised ; and in addition it must be remembered that over many<lb/>
parts of the body animals are able to twitch their skins violently and so<lb/>
dislodge or tear the stitches. Stitches should be as few as possible,<lb/>
every stitch separate with a good hold on each side and not drawn so<lb/>
taut as to cause any tension on the skin. Generally speaking, most<lb/>
wounds do not require it, and it often does more harm than good when<lb/>
dirty materials and hands carry it out. Needles, and everything else<lb/>
used on wounds, should be thoroughly cleaned, and boiled or kept in an<lb/>
antiseptic solution to prevent any chance of their conveying germs from<lb/>
one wound to another.
</p>

<p>
Wounds near joints should be touched with hands and instruments Wounds<lb/>
as little as possible and should not be fomented or poulticed. Every P^.^^<lb/>
joint is surrounded by a thin air-tight bag, the inside of which JÂ°^^^^-<lb/>
manufactures "joint oil" to lubricate the surfaces of the bones. Should

maggots or a little bubbling on the surface can be seen. Pick out all<lb/>
that are visible and swab out the wound with a pledget of tow which<lb/>
has been dipped in a disinfectant. Cover all wounds to keep off flies<lb/>
when they are troublesome.
</p>

<p>
.bscesses. Abscesses are collections of matter beneath the skin caused by germs ;<lb/>
a boil is a familiar example. Whenever matter is forming there is<lb/>
considerable inflammation of the parts around, which become more and<lb/>
more swollen. The swelling gradually becomes pointed as the matter<lb/>
presses its way through the skin, which ultimately gives way and the<lb/>
abscess bursts. Treatment. â Foment or poultice continually to soften<lb/>
the skin and allow the matter to press its way easily ; when pointed and<lb/>
soft at the top the swelling may be opened. When opened, cease<lb/>
fomenting and treat as an ordinary wound.

ractures. Fractures of the limbs among shod horses and mules are frequent,<lb/>

situations the bones are covered by skin only and are very liable to crack

when struck. If the bone is not seriously injured the swelling- which<lb/>
accompanies the injury subsides in a few days, but if it is cracked or<lb/>
badly bruised there is usually a persisting flat swelling, rather hard to the<lb/>
feel, and lameness. Even though cracked right through, the broken bones<lb/>
may not come apart, as they are covered with a very tough parchment-<lb/>
hke skin, and may unite again if rested. Tie up the animal to prevent<lb/>
lying down, as in rising a great strain is placed on the bones ; keep<lb/>
standing till the swelling disappears and the case is quite sound.<lb/>
Antiseptics to the wound.
</p>

<p>
In cattle, fracture of the horns is not uncommon, and when occurring<lb/>
in slaughter animals, they should be at once killed for food, but in<lb/>
draught animals they require treatment. If the horn is pendulous but the<lb/>
skin unbroken, replace it in position and tie a flat piece of wood across<lb/>
both horns to keep it so ; if the skin is broken it is generally best to<lb/>
remove the horn altogether and treat the wound antiseptically, but when<lb/>
practicable the animal had better be converted into beef.
</p>

<p>
Injuries to the eyes are usually due to blows or small objects getting Injuries to<lb/>
stuck on the front of the eyeball. The eye turns milky white, is closed the eyes,<lb/>
and weeps. Keep a cloth over to prevent light entering, oil below the<lb/>
eye to prevent tears making the skin sore, and apply weak boracic<lb/>
water. To remove anything from the front of the eye, wipe it firmly with<lb/>
a smooth cloth over the finger ; do)i!t poke ajiythi]ig into it. To save<lb/>
camels' eyes being injured, long tent poles should be carried with spikes<lb/>
to the front, pointing sliL^htly upwards and not protruding beyond the<lb/>
head. The poles should be lashed behind to splay the spikes outwards in<lb/>
front.

<p>
The eyelids of the camel are particularly liable to become inflamed. The<lb/>

and treated with boric acid either in powder or lotion. The use of '^^^^"^^^â¢<lb/>
irritating lotions, such as carbolic acid and zinc, should be especially<lb/>
noted as not suitable for injuries in the neighbourhood of the eyes and<lb/>
mouth.

Injuries to mouth. â The tongue is sometimes cut by the snaffle being Injuries to<lb/>
dragged across it or a twist of rope or chain placed in the mouth, mouth.<lb/>
These wounds recover very rapidly if kept clean after feeding, but they<lb/>
generally leave a deformity of the tongue. Boric acid lotion may be used<lb/>
as a dressing for them, but cleanliness is the main thing.
</p>

<p>
The bars of the mouth between the corner incisors and first molar Bit<lb/>
teeth may be injured by the pressure of the portmouth bit, which by injuries,<lb/>
allowing the tongue to escape through the port, exerts all its force on the<lb/>
bars. If the gum is merely bruised, it will be found swollen, tender, and<lb/>
red, and the horse will probably be restive to handle, but a few days' rest

or, as not unfrequently happens, is cracked, a hole will appear over the<lb/>
injury or possibly on the side of the jaw lower dov/n, from which issues a<lb/>
foetid discharge, the smell being characteristic of decaying bone, and an<lb/>
operation for its removal being frequently necessary. After ihe dead<lb/>
bone has been taken away the wound will heal rapidly.
</p>

<p>
Injuries to the nose. â The division between the nostrils is very apt to<lb/>
be injured in oxen and camels by the nose rope or stick which is passed<lb/>
through it, and if not attended to may become infested with maggots, and<lb/>
large pieces slough off. In the ox the cause is either too tight a nose<lb/>
rope or rough handling of it, and in the camel the practice of tying the<lb/>
nose rope to the animal in front is accountable for many injuries.<lb/>
Ordinary wound treatment and the addition of a drop or two of<lb/>
turpentine when maggots are present will be all that is required, provided<lb/>
the actual cause of the injury ceases. From the camel's nostril there<lb/>
occasionally issue large maggots which are not connected with wounds,<lb/>
and these are the larv^ (bots) of the gadfly of the animal.
</p>

<p>
Capped elbow is the term applied to the swelling which results from a<lb/>
bruise to the skin at the point of the elbow from lying on hard ground,<lb/>
sharp stones, and in shod animals sometimes on the shoe. In the horse<lb/>
it is most common. The camel is provided with a thickening of the<lb/>
skin at this point which usually protects it from injury ; but even this is<lb/>
not always sufficient. The symptoms are rapid swelling and inflam-<lb/>
mation of the skin, usually with a quantity of fluid beneath, and in very<lb/>
severe cases formation of an abscess ; it does not as a rule cause<lb/>
lameness, and the animal can generally be kept at work. Try and<lb/>
prevent re-injury by attention to the ground on which the animal rests ;<lb/>
in shod animals the inner quarter and heel of the shoe is sometimes<lb/>
removed. If the inflammation is very great, foment the place till it<lb/>
either bursts or the swelling gets smaller and keep standing up to<lb/>
prevent re-injury. For the horse, a small sausage-shaped pillow, long<lb/>
enough to surround the pastern and about four inches in diameter, will<lb/>
be found to prevent the elbow touching the ground when lying down.<lb/>
As the enlargement gets older it becomes smaller and harder, but is<lb/>
always liable to re-injury.
</p>

<p>
Elbow brushing in the camel is a serious condition resulting from the<lb/>
friction of the elbow pad against the side in animals which are tied in at<lb/>
the elbow and whose toes are turned out. It is a constant trouble, and<lb/>
in animals at hard work impossible to prevent. No camel with any signs<lb/>
of it should be purchased for transport, short journeys and light loads<lb/>
being the only means by which such can be worked.

<p>
The chest pad of the camel and also any of the other horny pads on The chest<lb/>
the elbow stifle and knee are liable to be bruised and cut by contact with P^d of the<lb/>
hard ground or rocks, and the injury is often aggravated by sand ^^"^^1-<lb/>
working into the fissures so caused, and matter not infrequently forms.<lb/>
When this happens care should be taken that there is a good opening for<lb/>
the matter to escape, and all channels from which it issues should be<lb/>
thoroughly syringed with an antiseptic. The most important detail,<lb/>
however, is to make sure that the wound is covered and protected from<lb/>
further injury, and this may be done by a soft pad of any material being<lb/>
fixed over the injured part. Tow, straw, bhoosa and sacking can always<lb/>
be obtained, and a large pillow with a hole in the centre will give ease<lb/>
and protection when the camel is lying down.
</p>

<p>
Broken knees are commonest among horses and mules, but working Broken<lb/>
oxen also are liable to this injury. The term is used to include all injuries knees,<lb/>
of the knee when the skin is broken, and these vary very greatly in<lb/>
severity. The skin on the knee joint is very thick and freely movable<lb/>
over the parts beneath, and probably the majority of broken knees do not<lb/>
cut through its actual thickness ; but the severity of the blow received is<lb/>
so great that large pieces of surrounding skin are often so badly bruised<lb/>
that they die and come away in the discharge ; so that a wound originally<lb/>
the size of a half-crown may in a week's time be twice as large and<lb/>
proportionately deeper. Immediately beneath the skin are the tendons<lb/>
running over the front of the joint, and beneath them again the joint oil<lb/>
bag and joint itself.
</p>

<p>
The cause of broken knees are â
</p>

<p>
(i) bad action ;
</p>

<p>
(2) animals being tired from overloading or overdriving ; especially
</p>

<p>
is this the cause when they are not in good condition ;
</p>

<p>
(3) long toes or too thick shoes, which have the same effect ;
</p>

<p>
(4) Saddle pressure from the burr of the side bar pressing on to and
</p>

<p>
interfering with the action of the shoulder-blade ; this shortens<lb/>
the stride and induces stumbfing.
</p>

<p>
Attention to the two last points before starting on a march will often<lb/>
obviate this particular accident, which when once done is sometimes<lb/>
beyond remedy, especially on service.
</p>

<p>
Treatment.â Q^vl^x-a\ wound treatment, absolute cleanliness, and do Treat-<lb/>
not poke the place about. If joint oil escapes from the wound, run a rnent.<lb/>
stream of cold water over it constantly until it ceases. Attention to saddle<lb/>
fitting, and shoeing and condition will prevent many of these accidents.

<p>
Speedy
</p>

<p>
cutting,
</p>

<p>
brushing
</p>

<p>
and
</p>

<p>
cutting.
</p>

<p>
Speedy cutlmg, brushing a?id ctitti7to;. â These three accidents are all<lb/>
caused by the animal striking the inside of the leg with the opposite foot<lb/>
or shoe.
</p>

<p>
Speedy cutting occurs just under the knee on the inside, and is caused<lb/>
at the gallop by a blow from the inside toe of the opposite foot, horses<lb/>
with crooked legs being most likely to do it. There may or may not be<lb/>
an actual cut in the skin, but in any case the bruise is the most serious<lb/>
part of the injury. The leg swells, is very painful, and when the blow is<lb/>
often repeated a permanent enlargement remains. If very painful,<lb/>
foment and afterwards apply a cold bandage ; shoe the opposite foot as<lb/>
close as possible at the inside toe and quarter, rasping off some of the<lb/>
wall if necessary, and rounding off the lower edge of the web of the shoe.<lb/>
This injury is only likely to occur in riding horses, and those which do it<lb/>
habitually are unsafe. Brushing is done at the trot and walk, and the<lb/>
inside of the fetlock is the point struck. It may be caused accidentally<lb/>
from animals being out of condition and over-tired, by the shoes being<lb/>
too wide inside, or may be due to the conformation of the legs,<lb/>
those in which the toes turn outwards from the fetlocks being most likely<lb/>
to be injured. Protecting boots or pads m.ay be made of numnah or<lb/>
blanket and tied round the leg above the fetlock, care being taken not to<lb/>
bind the string or strap so tight as to make the leg swell. For turned-<lb/>
out toes, brushing shoes should be fitted, these being thicker and<lb/>
narrower on the inside quarter and heel and well bevelled under the foot<lb/>
("feather-edged"). The wound itself requires but sHght attention,<lb/>
provided the cause be removed and the place protected from further<lb/>
injury, and it only becomes serious when from constant repetition of the<lb/>
blow the insides of the fetlocks get enlarged. Cutting or low brushing<lb/>
occurs at the walk from the opposite foot striking the inside of the<lb/>
coronet just where the horn and hoof join, and is not as a rule serious.
</p>

<p>
Condition is the best preventive of these injuries.
</p>

<p>
Treads a?td overreaches are practically the same injury, ^^â¢ith the<lb/>
exception that the overreach is caused by the animal striking its own<lb/>
foreleg with the hind foot, whereas the tread may be inflicted by another<lb/>
animal. Overreaches occur either above the fetlock of the foreleg<lb/>
(high overreach) or on the side of the coronet and back of the heels (low<lb/>
overreach) ; treads are generally found on the outside of the coronets and<lb/>
sometimes above the fetlock in the hind-legs. When severe they are<lb/>
most serious injuries, the tendons being cut through, or the coronets<lb/>
severely lacerated and bruised. In all cases, the wound being inflicted<lb/>
by a downward blow, there is generally an underlip of skin hanging from<lb/>
it, and in bandaging it, care should be taken to do so in such a manner
</p>

</p>

<p>
that the lip is retained in its proper position, where it will often heal, but<lb/>
should it be hanging by a small neck of skin only, it is better to cut it off<lb/>
at the outset. Treatment should consist of the application of antiseptics,<lb/>
and as a rule it will be found possible to bandage these injuries, which<lb/>
should be done from below upwards in order to keep the cut ends in<lb/>
position as described above, sufficiently thick pads of tow being placed<lb/>
under the bandages to prevent any undue pressure on the injured skin.
</p>

<p>
Many treads and overreaches occur when horses are suddenly and<lb/>
unexpectedly checked or when one rank rides into another, especially<lb/>
trotting down crowded and narrow roads. Extra care on these occasions<lb/>
will prevent a fair proportion.
</p>

<p>
Sprams may, of course, occur under all conditions, but they are not Sprains,<lb/>
so common in transport animals as in those whose work is faster.<lb/>
Pain, heat, and swelling will make their presence apparent, and unless<lb/>
these can be detected, other causes of lameness should be carefully<lb/>
sought.
</p>

<p>
In the camel, sprain of the muscles inside the thigh occurs "from<lb/>
splitting," z&amp;gt;., the hind legs slipping apart sideways on wet slippery<lb/>
ground. This is so frequent an accident that it is advisable when camels<lb/>
are likely to slip, owing to the ground and weather, to tie their hind<lb/>
legs together sufficiently close to prevent them spreading widely, but<lb/>
allowing them play enough to walk.
</p>

<p>
Sprains of tendons and ligaments are most frequent in the back<lb/>
tendon between the knee and fetlock of the horse's and mule's forelegs,<lb/>
and may also occur in the camel and working ox ; the fetlocks and<lb/>
hocks are also liable to sprains from sHps and stumbles in bad ground.<lb/>
In all cases the general symptoms of sprains are the same ; swelling ot<lb/>
the part, with pain on pressure, and unless these are present, the cause<lb/>
of lameness should be sought elsewhere. In addition, the part is hot,<lb/>
compared with the rest of the leg, but this is not so easily detected as<lb/>
the former signs. Lameness is always present, but many slight cases<lb/>
can Avork perfectly v. ell at a walk when required to do so.
</p>

<p>
Sprains of back tendons, if taken at once, may have a pressure<lb/>
bandage put on them. This is applied as follows : a thick pillow of<lb/>
wadding, cotton wool or tow is placed evenly round the leg, care<lb/>
being taken to have it so thick that the subsequent pressure of the<lb/>
bandage will not injure the skin. Over this is wound, as tightly and<lb/>
evenly as possible, an ordinary bandage. It should exert an even, firm<lb/>
pressure over the whole of the injured surface an extend well above<lb/>
and below it. The padding should also project at each end to ensure<lb/>
that there is no cutting of the skin by the edges of the bandage. When

<p>
this becomes loose it shows that the swelling is reduced and should be<lb/>
replaced. It is a simple and effective way of treating sprains when<lb/>
taken early and properly applied, but any treatment of severe sprains<lb/>
necessitates long rest from work.
</p>

<p>
Animals in co7iditioii are much less liable to all classes of sprain than<lb/>
those not fit.
</p>

<p>
Cracked Cracked heels and mud fever occur in the horse and mule from
</p>

<p>
heels and the skin of the heel or belly being " chapped." The surface is
</p>

<p>
mud fever, j^^^ ^^j^^ painful and a greasy discharge exudes from it (greasy heels).<lb/>
When severe the animal is frequently very lame, especially on first<lb/>
moving. The causes are washing and not thoroughly drying the legs,<lb/>
and sometimes constant standing in wet sloppy standings, in which case<lb/>
sores may frequently be found on the bulbs of the heel in addition.<lb/>
Treatmejit. â Thoroughly cleanse and dry the skin â if the greasy<lb/>
discharge is abundant, poultice with dry bran â apply boric powder or<lb/>
boric vaseline or any other non-irritating antiseptic, and place a pad<lb/>
of tow and a bandage lightly over. Give exercise regularly to keep the<lb/>
skin supple whilst the cracks are healing. These injuries are preventable<lb/>
in the great majority of cases.
</p>

<p>
Tail Tail sloughing is frequent among camels and sometimes elephants.
</p>

<p>
sloughing. In the former the practice of tying the leading rope of the animal<lb/>
behind to the tail of the one in front is responsible for the injury,<lb/>
as the pressure is very severe whenever the hinder one lags. Any<lb/>
having this injury should be placed at the rear of the line and the<lb/>
wound treated antiseptically.
</p>

<p>
Hip down. Hip dowii^ fracture of the point of the hips, may occur from animals<lb/>
falling sideways when playing with their neighbours in the lines. It<lb/>
may be detected by standing behind, when the injured hip looks rounder<lb/>
than its fellow. Such cases may be lame for a considerable time, and<lb/>
should be kept standing up until sound to prevent any split pieces of<lb/>
bone from becoming separated by the effort of rising and lying down.<lb/>
They usually make good recoveries, and the slighter cases may only be<lb/>
sick a short time. It is, of course, safer when practicable to give ihem<lb/>
all a long rest.
</p>

<p>
Stifle slip. Stifle slip, dislocation of the stifle cap, may occur in the horse, mule
</p>

<p>
and camel from slipping, straining on heel ropes or when struggling to<lb/>
pull a load. It is not common in the service, as it most frequently<lb/>
occurs among very young animals or those out of condition. The leg is<lb/>
dragged behind with the front of the foot on the ground and cannot be<lb/>
bent or brought forward ; there is an enlargement on the outside of<lb/>
the stifle caused by the displaced bone. Treatment.â VmX a rope round

<p>
the pastern and pull the foot forwards, backing the animal at the same<lb/>
time and push the displaced bone forwards and slightly downwards into<lb/>
its place. When replaced tie the foot forward either to a surcingle or a<lb/>
rope passed round the neck for 24 hours.
</p>

<p>
Capped hock is the same class of injury to the point of the hock as Capped<lb/>
takes place at the point of the elbow when bruised (see capped elbow), hock.<lb/>
It is caused by kicking, and rarely incapacitates the animal for work.
</p>

<p>
Heel galls^ from getting the heels over the picket rope or head rope or Heel galls.<lb/>
tied up in the heel rope, may occur in both fore and hind feet, those<lb/>
caused by getting the hind feet over the picket or head rope being much<lb/>
the most severe. They should be cleaned and treated antiseptically. If<lb/>
much inflamed a warm-water bandage will give relief from the pain, and<lb/>
daily exercise should be enforced to ensure the skin being kept supple<lb/>
during the healing process, or it may subsequently crack across as badly<lb/>
as before. They may be prevented by attention to the length of head<lb/>
and heel ropes when picketing.
</p>

<p>
Injuries to the Feet.
</p>

<p>
Pricks or stabs occur from nails being driven into the sensitive parts Pricks or<lb/>
of the foot or from accidental injury from sharp stones, &amp;c., on the road, stabs.<lb/>
Presses are caused from nails being driven too near the sensitive parts<lb/>
and causing inflammation of them by pressure.
</p>

<p>
The symptoms caused by these injuries are lameness, heat of the feet<lb/>
and pain on pressure with pincers ; when very severe the horse may rest<lb/>
the foot on the toe and the pain may be so great that the appetite fails.<lb/>
The cause should be thoroughly searched for as follows :â Press the foot<lb/>
with pincers at intervals of about \\ inches, commencing at one heel and<lb/>
going all round ; then try each side of the frog in the same manner :<lb/>
grip plenty of horn between the pincers and especially try over all the<lb/>
nail holes. Next, clean the horn with the rasp, or take off a thin shave<lb/>
with the knife and see if any injury or coarse nail hole can be detected ; if<lb/>
not, search every nail hole down by removing the horn from its inner<lb/>
side until it is certain that it comes out of the hoof without causing<lb/>
injury. The sole, especially at the seat of corn and both sides and<lb/>
cleft of the frog, should also be cleaned and thoroughly examined when<lb/>
the cause of lameness is suspected to be in the foot and cannot be<lb/>
located easily.
</p>

<p>
'''' Matter in the foot^' may result from any penetrating injury, and is a "Matter

<p>
cause the wounds to fester although the hole made in the horn may have<lb/>
closed completely. Unless discovered and let out from the ground<lb/>
surface of the foot, it gradually works its way up to and out at the<lb/>
coronet, when the resulting sore is called a " qiiittorr The pain caused<lb/>
by the formation of matter in the foot is intense, the animal is extremely<lb/>
lame and the foot hot. The quantity may be trifling and the colour is<lb/>
greyish. A good opening should be made in the horn to admit of a free<lb/>
discharge, and the wound syringed with antiseptics, care being taken to<lb/>
keep it opened till all discharge has ceased, and dirt should be excluded<lb/>
by a tow pad and boot on the foot. The foot may be poulticed or stood<lb/>
in warm water to relieve the pain and soften the horn. To retain<lb/>
dressings in the sole of the foot a piece of tin may be slipped under the<lb/>
edges of the shoe and pressed flat, and this will be found useful when<lb/>
boots are not available and the injury is to the sole or frog.<lb/>
Bruises to Biiiisesto the sole are not common when the horn of the sole is left<lb/>
the sole, uncut, as it is usually sufficiently thick to protect the sensitive parts<lb/>
effectively ; they may, however, occur in stony ground and when animals<lb/>
are heavily loaded. They may be detected by pain on pressure over the<lb/>
injury and by a red stain on the horn caused by the blood from the<lb/>
bruised fleshy sole soaking through. A leather sole nailed on beneath<lb/>
the shoe is usually sufficient to give relief, and it is important not to pare<lb/>
out the sole, but al'ow it to grow its full thickness.<lb/>
Corns. Corns are bruises to the fleshy sole at the angle of the heel between
</p>

<p>
the wall and the bar. They are caused by any undue pressure on this<lb/>
part, and both low flat-heeled feet and narrow high-heeled ones are<lb/>
liable to them.
</p>

<p>
Short or narrow-heeled shoes which do not take a fair bearing on wall<lb/>
and bar, or the wearing of shoes for too long a time without removal, so<lb/>
that they are carried forward by the growth of the foot and become short,<lb/>
are all frequent causes of this injury.
</p>

<p>
Treatment of corns should, in the first instance, be directed to the<lb/>
removal of the pressure, whatever may be its cause. In slight cases<lb/>
removal of a small portion of the bruised horn and seating of the heel of<lb/>
the shoe may be found sufficient, but the more serious require poulticing<lb/>
or soaking in hot water, and where the bruise has been so severe that<lb/>
matter has gathered in the heel (festering corn), this must be given a free<lb/>
exit and subsequently treated antiseptically. A broad bearing shoe with<lb/>
the heel well seated, or a three-quarter shoe, are the most serviceable for<lb/>
such cases.<lb/>
The feet of The feet of'W07'king oxen which are shod are liable to pricks and the<lb/>

<p>
the claw when working or standing in wet ground for any length of time,<lb/>
and in some cases these may extend beneath the horn at the coronet.<lb/>
The principles of treatment are the same in all cases ; any horn which is<lb/>
underrun should be removed, a free opening given to any matter, and the<lb/>
wounds treated with antiseptics. A figure of 8 bandage with a pad of<lb/>
tow underneath may be conveniently bound between the claws, and should<lb/>
not be too tight or so bulky as to spread them much.
</p>

<p>
The feet of the camel 2iX^ liable to sustain injuries from sharp stones The' feet of<lb/>
when marching, and cracks sometimes extend through the horny pad or the cameh<lb/>
the sole of the foot and cause severe lameness. ' These should be<lb/>
thoroughly cleaned, and if underrun by matter, sufficient of the horny pad<lb/>
removed to allow free drainage, subsequent treatment being as for all<lb/>
other injuries.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the antiseptic dressings previously mentioned, Stock-<lb/>
holm tar should be added as a very useful one in wounds of the foot. It<lb/>
should be applied with a pad of tow after the wounds have ceased to<lb/>
discharge and are healing, until the horn has again grown hard over the<lb/>
injured parts.
</p>

<p>
Foot soreiuss may occur in all animals, and is due to the horn of the Foot<lb/>
sole in horses, mules, and oxen, and the horny pad of the foot in camels soreness.<lb/>
and elephants being worn unduly thin. This may be caused by working<lb/>
on wet or stony roads or over-marching. In the case of those which can<lb/>
be shod, that is the obvious remedy, the shoes being seated to avoid<lb/>
pressure on the soles. In the elephant and camel less work is the<lb/>
only remedy, and the feet may be hardened by an application of
</p>

<p>
chobe."
</p>

<p>
Lameness.
</p>

<p>
Lameness may best be detected at a slow trot when the animal is not Lameness,<lb/>
excited, and it should be led straight away from and back towards the<lb/>
person examining it. When any animal is lame, it takes as much weight<lb/>
as possible off the injured or painful limb and places it on the opposite<lb/>
one. The extra weight placed on the sound side gives an uneven<lb/>
appearance to the action. If lame of a foreleg the animal will be seen<lb/>
to "bob ''^ its head, when trotting towards you, every time the sound foot<lb/>
comes on to the ground. If lame behind, you will see that the hock of<lb/>
the sound leg rises higher and dips lower than that of the lame one when<lb/>
the animal is trotting away from you. In each case the bobbing. of the<lb/>
head and the dipping of the hock is caused by the extra weight placed on<lb/>
the sound side. Animals lame of both fore or both hind legs take short<lb/>

strides with both, "potter" along instead of striding out, and are most<lb/>
difficult to detect when the lameness is not severe. An animal very lame<lb/>
of one foreleg appears to be lame of the diagonal hind leg also when<lb/>
trotting away ; this appearance is deceptive to the beginner, and practice<lb/>
alone will enable anyone to recognise it.
</p>

<p>
In horses the majority of causes of lameness occur at or below the knee<lb/>
and hock ; lameness in the shoulder and hip are comparatively rare, and<lb/>
the foot is the most common seat. In all cases where no apparent and<lb/>
sufficient cause can be detected, the foot should be thoroughly examined,<lb/>
and the case regarded as foot lameness till the cause is discovered.
</p>

<p>
Splhits are bony growths on the cannon bones of horses and mules,<lb/>
chiefly on the insides of the forelegs, but they may occur on the outside.<lb/>
They lame as a rule only whilst they are growing, and become callous as<lb/>
they get older ; in animals which work slowly they are not a common<lb/>
cause of lameness, and they do not usually cause trouble in animals over<lb/>
six years old.
</p>

<p>
Sore shins may occasionally occur after severe marches. The lower<lb/>
part of the cannon bones are painful and hot and the animal lame ; there<lb/>
may even be some swelling over the place, which is "doughy" to the<lb/>
feel. Hot water applications until the pain is gone, followed by a cold<lb/>
bandage, will relieve the condition, and rest is essential till recovery is<lb/>
complete.
</p>

<p>
Ritio bojies are bony enlargements of the pasterns anywhere between<lb/>
the fetlock and coronet, and they occur on all four legs. In mules and<lb/>
horses, which are constantly shackled by the hind legs, they are often<lb/>
seen as a result of the irritation of the hobble, and this particular variety<lb/>
is much less serious than when they occur in the forelegs. They may<lb/>
occasion severe and continuous lameness which incapacitates the animal<lb/>
for all fast work, though often capable of working at a walk, and in<lb/>
consequence they may not always militate against usefulness for trans-<lb/>
port.
</p>

<p>
Side bones are occasioned by the cartilages at the sides of the foot<lb/>
being converted into bone, and are most common among heavy horses.<lb/>
They seldom prevent animals working at a slow pace, but may occasion-<lb/>
ally cause lameness after unusually long marches, when the feet should<lb/>
be wrapped in cold-water cloths. The cause of lameness from side bone<lb/>
is the concussion caused by the want of spring in the bony cartilages and,<lb/>
as before remarked, animals not required for fast work may be perfectly<lb/>
useful notwithstanding their presence.
</p>

<p>
Laminitis^ " fever in the feet," is an inflamed condition of the fleshy<lb/>
leaves which are found beneath the wall of the hoof and covering the

<p>
coffin bone. It is generally caused by over-exertion, particularly when<lb/>
the animal is in an unfit state to undergo it ; horses which have been at<lb/>
rest for any time, especially if they have been overfed, being very likely to<lb/>
suffer if suddenly put to heavy work. In animals which are unshod it is<lb/>
often a sequel to foot-soreness, and after a sea voyage it is of frequent<lb/>
occurrence unless care is taken to graduate the exercise given immediately<lb/>
on landing. The symptoms are heat and pain in the feet, usually both<lb/>
fore feet, and severe lameness ; the patient stands still and is unwilling to<lb/>
pick up either foot as the pain in the other is thereby greatly increased,<lb/>
and when forced to move, the heels are markedly brought to the ground<lb/>
first. The blood vessels at the fetlock may be felt throtbing, and in<lb/>
severe cases the appetite fails and there is fever.
</p>

<p>
Treatment. â Give a physic ball and sloppy bran and green food Treat-<lb/>
only. Take off the shoes and replace them by a pair of thick wide- ment.<lb/>
seated, bar shoes ; make the animal take a little exercise several times a<lb/>
day, a few minutes at a time, and keep cold swabs over the hoofs. If the<lb/>
animal will lie down and rest make it comfortable, and poultice the feet,<lb/>
or wrap them in hot-water cloths. In all cases keep the bowels freely<lb/>
open. After recovery, continue to use broad-seated shoes for a con-<lb/>
siderable time.
</p>

<p>
Condition is the sole preventive for laminitis on service. It is a<lb/>
common but preventable condition.
</p>

<p>
In bad cases of fever in the feet, the coffin bone is often forced<lb/>
downwards and bulges the sole of the foot (dropped sole) just in front of<lb/>
the point of the frog, and as such cases are not sufficiently useful to be<lb/>
kept in the service, they are cast or destroyed.
</p>

<p>
Sand crack is a splitting of the horn of the wall of the hoof which Sand<lb/>
occurs at the inside quarter of the fore feet and occasionally at the toe of crack,<lb/>
the hind feet. It commences at the coronet and extends downwards, the<lb/>
depth of the crack being right through the thickness of the wall into the<lb/>
fleshy leaves beneath. It occasions lameness from the pain caused by<lb/>
the spHt closing on the sensitive parts beneath, and may sometimes be<lb/>
found to be bleeding.
</p>

<p>
Clean out the crack and pare the edges thin, dress it antiseptically,<lb/>
put a small pad of cotton wool in the crack and bind the top of the hoof<lb/>
with narrow tape which has been soaked in a mixture of equal parts of<lb/>
resin and pitch (melted together with a very small portion of wax). This<lb/>
will form a solid binding when cold and keep the crack a fixture. If<lb/>
possible, rest the animal till the split grows down half an inch from the<lb/>
coronet, and then cut a horizontal groove deeply above it to separate it<lb/>
from the new growing horn, and prevent further splitting upwards.<lb/>

<p>
Thrush is an inflammation of the fleshy frog vi^hich results in a<lb/>
stinking discharge from the cleft ; it is caused by dirt, wet, and neglect,<lb/>
and is particularly liable to occur in shod animals whose frogs are not on<lb/>
the ground or are cut about, and, when severe, may cause lameness.<lb/>
The cleft of the frog should be thoroughly cleaned, and a dressing of<lb/>
boric powder applied dry will stop the discharge. When severe,<lb/>
the foot should be poulticed or soaked in hot water till thoroughly<lb/>
cleaned before the dressing is applied. Cleanliness, dryness, and frog<lb/>
pressure are the points which demand particular attention. It is largely<lb/>
preventable.
</p>

<p>
Bog spavin is a distention of the joint oil bag of the hock at the inner<lb/>
and upper part of the joint ; it rarely causes lameness except in animals<lb/>
which are worked with heavy loads in a hilly country, when it becomes<lb/>
a somewhat frequent cause of trouble. When causing lameness the<lb/>
enlargement will be found tense and hot and sometimes painful to the<lb/>
touch, and may be fomented till the pain disappears, or a cold wet cloth<lb/>
applied till it is cool.
</p>

<p>
Bone spavin is the growing together of the small bones at the inner<lb/>
and lower part of the hock, so that they become a solid mass ; the<lb/>
enlargement caused by it may be most easily observed by comparing the<lb/>
hocks one with another, standing outside each foreleg in turn to look<lb/>
at the insides of the hocks, or it may be felt by the hand. When once the<lb/>
bones have grown firmly together it does not often incapacitate animals<lb/>
from working, nor does it always cause lameness ; when it does there<lb/>
is usually a dragging of the toe of the affected limb.
</p>

<p>
Curb is a sprain at the back of the hock, about four or five inches<lb/>
below the point, and may be best observed by standing at the side of the<lb/>
animal. It usually causes lameness when first done, and the place is<lb/>
swollen and painful, but subsequently it rarely causes trouble.
</p>

<p>
Wind galls are enlargements of the joint oil bags above and at the<lb/>
sides of the fetlocks, where they may be seen as small, round, soft<lb/>
swellings, which are easily compressed and painless. They rarely<lb/>
occasion lameness, and most hard-worked animals have them, but they<lb/>
may become inflamed if the anunal brushes them.
</p>

<p>
Horse sickness. â This is a South African disease fatal to horses and<lb/>
mules. The visible onset of the disease is usually very sudden, the<lb/>
animal falls shortly after it is noticed to be ill, quantities of froth are<lb/>
voided from the nose, and death is rapid. Attempts at cure are of no<lb/>
avail. The exact cause of the disease is not yet known, but observation<lb/>
points to the great probability of its being transmitted by mosquitoes<lb/>
which bite during the night only. Preventive measures based on this

view have given good results, and the following precautions are at<lb/>
present observed in South Africa.
</p>

<p>
(i) During the horse sickness season, i.e.^ from November till June,
</p>

<p>
or until the first post, no horse or mule is taken out of stables
</p>

<p>
between sunset and sunrise.
</p>

<p>
(2) Water is not allowed to stand in or near stables, and all vegetation,
</p>

<p>
except trees, is removed from them.
</p>

<p>
(3) Some dung is allowed to remain behind the horses, as mosquitos
</p>

<p>
will not approach it, and smoke fires are lighted at the entrances<lb/>
of stables.
</p>

<p>
(4) As the blood of the affected is very virulent, carcases are cremated
</p>

<p>
and standings thoroughly disinfected.<lb/>
The preventive inoculation of mules has also given satisfactory results<lb/>
and is being carried out.
